June
sunshine.
Balashev
was
only
two
horses'
length
from
the
equestrian
with
the
bracelets,
plumes,
necklaces,
and
gold
embroidery,
who
was
galloping
toward
him
with
a
theatrically
solemn
countenance,
when
Julner,
the
French
colonel,
whispered
respectfully:
"The
King
of
Naples!"
It
was,
in
fact,
Murat,
now
called
"King
of
Naples."
Though
it
was
quite
incomprehensible
why
he
should
be
King
of
Naples,
he
was
called
so,
and
was
himself
convinced
that
he
was
so,
and
therefore
assumed
a
more
solemn
and
important
air
than
formerly.
He
was
so
sure
that
he
really
was
the
King
of
Naples
that
when,
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
from
that
city,
while
walking
through
the
streets
with
his
wife,
some
Italians
called
out
to
him:
"Viva
il
re!"
*
he
turned
to
his
wife
with
a
pensive
smile
and
said:
"Poor
fellows,
they
don't
know
that
I
am
leaving
them
tomorrow!"
*
"Long
live
the
king."
But
though
he
firmly
believed
himself
to
be
King
of
Naples
and
pitied
the
grief
felt
by
the
subjects
he
was
abandoning,
latterly,
after
he
had
been
ordered
to
return
to
military
service--and
especially
since
his
last
interview
with
Napoleon
in
Danzig,
when
his
august
brother-in-law
had
told
him:
"I
made
you
King
that
you
should
reign
in
my
way,
but
not
in
yours!"--he
had
cheerfully
taken
up
his
familiar
business,
and--like
a
well-fed
but
not
overfat
horse
that
feels
himself
in
harness
and
grows
skittish
between
the
shafts--he
dressed
up
in
clothes
as
variegated
and
expensive
as
possible,
and
gaily
and
contentedly
galloped
along
the
roads
of
Poland,
without
himself
knowing
why
or
whither.
On
seeing
the
Russian
general
he
threw
back
his
head,
with
its
long
hair
curling
to
his
shoulders,
in
a
majestically
royal
manner,
and
looked
inquiringly
at
the
French
colonel.
The
colonel
respectfully
informed
His
Majesty
of
Balashev's
mission,
whose
name
he
could
not
pronounce.
"De
Bal-macheve!"
said
the
King
(overcoming
by
his
assurance
the
difficulty
that
had
presented
itself
to
the
colonel).
"Charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance,
General!"
he
added,
with
a
gesture
of
kingly
condescension.
As
soon
as
the
King
began
to
speak
loud
and
fast
his
royal
dignity
instantly
forsook
him,
and
without
noticing
it
he
passed
into
his
natural
tone
of
good-natured
familiarity.
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
withers
of
Balashev's
horse
and
said:
"Well,
General,
it
all
looks
like
war,"
as
if
regretting
a
circumstance
of
which
he
was
unable
to
judge.
"Your
Majesty,"
replied
Balashev,
"my
master,
the
Emperor,
does
not
desire
war
and
as
Your
Majesty
sees..."
said
Balashev,
using
the
words
Your
Majesty
at
every
opportunity,
with
the
affectation
unavoidable
in
frequently
addressing
one
to
whom
the
title
was
still
a
novelty.
Murat's
face
beamed
with
stupid
satisfaction
as
he
listened
to
"Monsieur
de
Bal-macheve."
But
royaute
oblige!
*
and
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him,
as
a
king
and
an
ally,
to
confer
on
state
affairs
with
Alexander's
envoy.
He
dismounted,
took
Balashev's
arm,
and
moving
a
few
steps
away
from
his
suite,
which
waited
respectfully,
began
to
pace
up
and
down
with
him,
trying
to
speak
significantly.
He
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
Emperor
Napoleon
had
resented
the
demand
that
he
should
withdraw
his
troops
from
Prussia,
especially
when
that
demand
became
generally
known
and
the
dignity
of
France
was
thereby
offended.
*
"Royalty
has
its
obligations."
Balashev
replied
that
there
was
"nothing
offensive
in
the
demand,
because..."
but
Murat
interrupted
him.
"Then
you
don't
consider
the
Emperor
Alexander
the
aggressor?"
he
asked
unexpectedly,
with
a
kindly
and
foolish
smile.
Balashev
told
him
why
he
considered
Napoleon
to
be
the
originator
of
the
war.
"Oh,
my
dear
general!"
Murat
again
interrupted
him,
"with
all
my
heart
I
wish
the
Emperors
may
arrange
the
affair
between
them,
and
that
the
war
begun
by
no
wish
of
mine
may
finish
as
quickly
as
possible!"
said
he,
in
the
tone
of
a
servant
who
wants
to
remain
good
friends
with
another
despite
a
quarrel
between
their
masters.
And
he
went
on
to
inquiries
about
the
Grand
Duke
and
the
state
of
his
health,
and
to
reminiscences
of
the
gay
and
amusing
times
he
had
spent
with
him
in
Naples.
Then
suddenly,
as
if
remembering
his
royal
dignity,
Murat
solemnly
drew
himself
up,
assumed
the
pose
in
which
he
had
stood
at
his
coronation,
and,
waving
his
right
arm,
said:
"I
won't
detain
you
longer,
General.
I
wish
success
to
your
mission,"
and
with
his
embroidered
red
mantle,
his
flowing
feathers,
and
his
glittering
ornaments,
he
rejoined
his
suite
who
were
respectfully
awaiting
him.
Balashev
rode
on,
supposing
from
Murat's
words
that
he
would
very
soon
be
brought
before
Napoleon
himself.
But
instead
of
that,
at
the
next
village
the
sentinels
of
Davout's
infantry
corps
detained
him
as
the
pickets
of
the
vanguard
had
done,
and
an
adjutant
of
the
corps
commander,
who
was
fetched,
conducted
him
into
the
village
to
Marshal
Davout.
CHAPTER
V
Davout
was
to
Napoleon
what
Arakcheev
was
to
Alexander--though
not
a
coward
like
Arakcheev,
he
was
as
precise,
as
cruel,
and
as
unable
to
express
his
devotion
to
his
monarch
except
by
cruelty.
In
the
organism
of
states
such
men
are
necessary,
as
wolves
are
necessary
in
the
organism
of
nature,
and
they
always
exist,
always
appear
and
hold
their
own,
however
incongruous
their
presence
and
their
proximity
to
the
head
of
the
government
may
be.
This
inevitability
alone
can
explain
how
the
cruel
Arakcheev,
who
tore
out
a
grenadier's
mustache
with
his
own
hands,
whose
weak
nerves
rendered
him
unable
to
face
danger,
and
who
was
neither
an
educated
man
nor
a
courtier,
was
able
to
maintain
his
powerful
position
with
Alexander,
whose
own
character
was
chivalrous,
noble,
and
gentle.
Balashev
found
Davout
seated
on
a
barrel
in
the
shed
of
a
peasant's
hut,
writing--he
was
auditing
accounts.
Better
quarters
could
have
been
found
him,
but
Marshal
Davout
was
one
of
those
men
who
purposely
put
themselves
in
most
depressing
conditions
to
have
a
justification
for
being
gloomy.
For
the
same
reason
they
are
always
hard
at
work
and
in
a
hurry.
"How
can
I
think
of
the
bright
side
of
life
when,
as
you
see,
I
am
sitting
on
a
barrel
and
working
in
a
dirty
shed?"
the
expression
of
his
face
seemed
to
say.
The
chief
pleasure
and
necessity
of
such
men,
when
they
encounter
anyone
who
shows
animation,
is
to
flaunt
their
own
dreary,
persistent
activity.
Davout
allowed
himself
that
pleasure
when
Balashev
was
brought
in.
He
became
still
more
absorbed
in
his
task
when
the
Russian
general
entered,
and
after
glancing
over
his
spectacles
at
Balashev's
face,
which
was
animated
by
the
beauty
of
the
morning
and
by
his
talk
with
Murat,
he
did
not
rise
or
even
stir,
but
scowled
still
more
and
sneered
malevolently.
When
he
noticed
in
Balashev's
face
the
disagreeable
impression
this
reception
produced,
Davout
raised
his
head
and
coldly
asked
what
he
wanted.
Thinking
he
could
have
been
received
in
such
a
manner
only
because
Davout
did
not
know
that
he
was
adjutant
general
to
the
Emperor
Alexander
and
even
his
envoy
to
Napoleon,
Balashev
hastened
to
inform
him
of
his
rank
and
mission.
Contrary
to
his
expectation,
Davout,
after
hearing
him,
became
still
surlier
and
ruder.
"Where
is
your
dispatch?"
he
inquired.
"Give
it
to
me.
I
will
send
it
to
the
Emperor."
Balashev
replied
that
he
had
been
ordered
to
hand
it
personally
to
the
Emperor.
"Your
Emperor's
orders
are
obeyed
in
your
army,
but
here,"
said
Davout,
"you
must
do
as
you're
told."
And,
as
if
to
make
the
Russian
general
still
more
conscious
of
his
dependence
on
brute
force,
Davout
sent
an
adjutant
to
call
the
officer
on
duty.
Balashev
took
out
the
packet
containing
the
Emperor's
letter
and
laid
it
on
the
table
(made
of
a
door
with
its
hinges
still
hanging
on
it,
laid
across
two
barrels).
Davout
took
the
packet
and
read
the
inscription.
"You
are
perfectly
at
liberty
to
treat
me
with
respect
or
not,"
protested
Balashev,
"but
permit
me
to
observe
that
I
have
the
honor
to
be
adjutant
general
to
His
Majesty...."
Davout
glanced
at
him
silently
and
plainly
derived
pleasure
from
the
signs
of
agitation
and
confusion
which
appeared
on
Balashev's
face.
"You
will
be
treated
as
is
fitting,"
said
he
and,
putting
the
packet
in
his
pocket,
left
the
shed.
A
minute
later
the
marshal's
adjutant,
de
Castres,
came
in
and
conducted
Balashev
to
the
quarters
assigned
him.
That
day
he
dined
with
the
marshal,
at
the
same
board
on
the
barrels.
Next
day
Davout
rode
out
early
and,
after
asking
Balashev
to
come
to
him,
peremptorily
requested
him
to
remain
there,
to
move
on
with
the
baggage
train
should
orders
come
for
it
to
move,
and
to
talk
to
no
one
except
Monsieur
de
Castres.
After
four
days
of
solitude,
ennui,
and
consciousness
of
his
impotence
and
insignificance--particularly
acute
by
contrast
with
the
sphere
of
power
in
which
he
had
so
lately
moved--and
after
several
marches
with
the
marshal's
baggage
and
the
French
army,
which
occupied
the
whole
district,
Balashev
was
brought
to
Vilna--now
occupied
by
the
French--
through
the
very
gate
by
which
he
had
left
it
four
days
previously.
Next
day
the
imperial
gentleman-in-waiting,
the
Comte
de
Turenne,
came
to
Balashev
and
informed
him
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon's
wish
to
honor
him
with
an
audience.
Four
days
before,
sentinels
of
the
Preobrazhensk
regiment
had
stood
in
front
of
the
house
to
which
Balashev
was
conducted,
and
now
two
French
grenadiers
stood
there
in
blue
uniforms
unfastened
in
front
and
with
shaggy
caps
on
their
heads,
and
an
escort
of
hussars
and
uhlans
and
a
brilliant
suite
of
aides-de-camp,
pages,
and
generals,
who
were
waiting
for
Napoleon
to
come
out,
were
standing
at
the
porch,
round
his
saddle
horse
and
his
Mameluke,
Rustan.
Napoleon
received
Balashev
in
the
very
house
in
Vilna
from
which
Alexander
had
dispatched
him
on
his
mission.
CHAPTER
VI
Though
Balashev
was
used
to
imperial
pomp,
he
was
amazed
at
the
luxury
and
magnificence
of
Napoleon's
court.
The
Comte
de
Turenne
showed
him
into
a
big
reception
room
where
many
generals,
gentlemen-in-waiting,
and
Polish
magnates--several
of
whom
Balashev
had
seen
at
the
court
of
the
Emperor
of
Russia--were
waiting.
Duroc
said
that
Napoleon
would
receive
the
Russian
general
before
going
for
his
ride.
After
some
minutes,
the
gentleman-in-waiting
who
was
on
duty
came
into
the
great
reception
room
and,
bowing
politely,
asked
Balashev
to
follow
him.
Balashev
went
into
a
small
reception
room,
one
door
of
which
led
into
a
study,
the
very
one
from
which
the
Russian
Emperor
had
dispatched
him
on
his
mission.
He
stood
a
minute
or
two,
waiting.
He
heard
hurried
footsteps
beyond
the
door,
both
halves
of
it
were
opened
rapidly;
all
was
silent
and
then
from
the
study
the
sound
was
heard
of
other
steps,
firm
and
resolute--they
were
those
of
Napoleon.
He
had
just
finished
dressing
for
his
ride,
and
wore
a
blue
uniform,
opening
in
front
over
a
white
waistcoat
so
long
that
it
covered
his
rotund
stomach,
white
leather
breeches
tightly
fitting
the
fat
thighs
of
his
short
legs,
and
Hessian
boots.
His
short
hair
had
evidently
just
been
brushed,
but
one
lock
hung
down
in
the
middle
of
his
broad
forehead.
His
plump
white
neck
stood
out
sharply
above
the
black
collar
of
his
uniform,
and
he
smelled
of
Eau
de
Cologne.
His
full
face,
rather
young-looking,
with
its
prominent
chin,
wore
a
gracious
and
majestic
expression
of
imperial
welcome.
He
entered
briskly,
with
a
jerk
at
every
step
and
his
head
slightly
thrown
back.
His
whole
short
corpulent
figure
with
broad
thick
shoulders,
and
chest
and
stomach
involuntarily
protruding,
had
that
imposing
and
stately
appearance
one
sees
in
men
of
forty
who
live
in
comfort.
It
was
evident,
too,
that
he
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
that
day.
He
nodded
in
answer
to
Balashav's
low
and
respectful
bow,
and
coming
up
to
him
at
once
began
speaking
like
a
man
who
values
every
moment
of
his
time
and
does
not
condescend
to
prepare
what
he
has
to
say
but
is
sure
he
will
always
say
the
right
thing
and
say
it
well.
"Good
day,
General!"
said
he.
"I
have
received
the
letter
you
brought
from
the
Emperor
Alexander
and
am
very
glad
to
see
you."
He
glanced
with
his
large
eyes
into
Balashav's
face
and
immediately
looked
past
him.
It
was
plain
that
Balashev's
personality
did
not
interest
him
at
all.
Evidently
only
what
took
place
within
his
own
mind
interested
him.
Nothing
outside
himself
had
any
significance
for
him,
because
everything
in
the
world,
it
seemed
to
him,
depended
entirely
on
his
will.
"I
do
not,
and
did
not,
desire
war,"
he
continued,
"but
it
has
been
forced
on
me.
Even
now"
(he
emphasized
the
word)
"I
am
ready
to
receive
any
explanations
you
can
give
me."
And
he
began
clearly
and
concisely
to
explain
his
reasons
for
dissatisfaction
with
the
Russian
government.
Judging
by
the
calmly
moderate
and
amicable
tone
in
which
the
French
Emperor
spoke,
Balashev
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
wished
for
peace
and
intended
to
enter
into
negotiations.
When
Napoleon,
having
finished
speaking,
looked
inquiringly
at
the
Russian
envoy,
Balashev
began
a
speech
he
had
prepared
long
before:
"Sire!
The
Emperor,
my
master..."
but
the
sight
of
the
Emperor's
eyes
bent
on
him
confused
him.
"You
are
flurried--compose
yourself!"
Napoleon
seemed
to
say,
as
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
he
looked
at
Balashev's
uniform
and
sword.
Balashev
recovered
himself
and
began
to
speak.
He
said
that
the
Emperor
Alexander
did
not
consider
Kurakin's
demand
for
his
passports
a
sufficient
cause
for
war;
that
Kurakin
had
acted
on
his
own
initiative
and
without
his
sovereign's
assent,
that
the
Emperor
Alexander
did
not
desire
war,
and
had
no
relations
with
England.
"Not
yet!"
interposed
Napoleon,
and,
as
if
fearing
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings,
he
frowned
and
nodded
slightly
as
a
sign
that
Balashev
might
proceed.
After
saying
all
he
had
been
instructed
to
say,
Balashev
added
that
the
Emperor
Alexander
wished
for
peace,
but
would
not
enter
into
negotiations
except
on
condition
that...
Here
Balashev
hesitated:
he
remembered
the
words
the
Emperor
Alexander
had
not
written
in
his
letter,
but
had
specially
inserted
in
the
rescript
to
Saltykov
and
had
told
Balashev
to
repeat
to
Napoleon.
Balashev
remembered
these
words,
"So
long
as
a
single
armed
foe
remains
on
Russian
soil,"
but
some
complex
feeling
restrained
him.
He
could
not
utter
them,
though
he
wished
to
do
so.
He
grew
confused
and
said:
"On
condition
that
the
French
army
retires
beyond
the
Niemen."
Napoleon
noticed
Balashev's
embarrassment
when
uttering
these
last
words;
his
face
twitched
and
the
calf
of
his
left
leg
began
to
quiver
rhythmically.
Without
moving
from
where
he
stood
he
began
speaking
in
a
louder
tone
and
more
hurriedly
than
before.
During
the
speech
that
followed,
Balashev,
who
more
than
once
lowered
his
eyes,
involuntarily
noticed
the
quivering
of
Napoleon's
left
leg
which
increased
the
more
Napoleon
raised
his
voice.
"I
desire
peace,
no
less
than
the
Emperor
Alexander,"
he
began.
"Have
I
not
for
eighteen
months
been
doing
everything
to
obtain
it?
I
have
waited
eighteen
months
for
explanations.
But
in
order
to
begin
negotiations,
what
is
demanded
of
me?"
he
said,
frowning
and
making
an
energetic
gesture
of
inquiry
with
his
small
white
plump
hand.
"The
withdrawal
of
your
army
beyond
the
Niemen,
sire,"
replied
Balashev.
"The
Niemen?"
repeated
Napoleon.
"So
now
you
want
me
to
retire
beyond
the
Niemen--only
the
Niemen?"
repeated
Napoleon,
looking
straight
at
Balashev.
The
latter
bowed
his
head
respectfully.
Instead
of
the
demand
of
four
months
earlier
to
withdraw
from
Pomerania,
only
a
withdrawal
beyond
the
Niemen
was
now
demanded.
Napoleon
turned
quickly
and
began
to
pace
the
room.
"You
say
the
demand
now
is
that
I
am
to
withdraw
beyond
the
Niemen
before
commencing
negotiations,
but
in
just
the
same
way
two
months
ago
the
demand
was
that
I
should
withdraw
beyond
the
Vistula
and
the
Oder,
and
yet
you
are
willing
to
negotiate."
He
went
in
silence
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
and
again
stopped
in
front
of
Balashev.
Balashev
noticed
that
his
left
leg
was
quivering
faster
than
before
and
his
face
seemed
petrified
in
its
stern
expression.
This
quivering
of
his
left
leg
was
a
thing
Napoleon
was
conscious
of.
"The
vibration
of
my
left
calf
is
a
great
sign
with
me,"
he
remarked
at
a
later
date.
"Such
demands
as
to
retreat
beyond
the
Vistula
and
Oder
may
be
made
to
a
Prince
of
Baden,
but
not
to
me!"
Napoleon
almost
screamed,
quite
to
his
own
surprise.
"If
you
gave
me
Petersburg
and
Moscow
I
could
not
accept
such
conditions.
You
say
I
have
begun
this
war!
But
who
first
joined
his
army?
The
Emperor
Alexander,
not
I!
And
you
offer
me
negotiations
when
I
have
expended
millions,
when
you
are
in
alliance
with
England,
and
when
your
position
is
a
bad
one.
You
offer
me
negotiations!
But
what
is
the
aim
of
your
alliance
with
England?
What
has
she
given
you?"
he
continued
hurriedly,
evidently
no
longer
trying
to
show
the
advantages
of
peace
and
discuss
its
possibility,
but
only
to
prove
his
own
rectitude
and
power
and
Alexander's
errors
and
duplicity.
The
commencement
of
his
speech
had
obviously
been
made
with
the
intention
of
demonstrating
the
advantages
of
his
position
and
showing
that
he
was
nevertheless
willing
to
negotiate.
But
he
had
begun
talking,
and
the
more
he
talked
the
less
could
he
control
his
words.
The
whole
purport
of
his
remarks
now
was
evidently
to
exalt
himself
and
insult
Alexander--just
what
he
had
least
desired
at
the
commencement
of
the
interview.
"I
hear
you
have
made
peace
with
Turkey?"
Balashev
bowed
his
head
affirmatively.
"Peace
has
been
concluded..."
he
began.
But
Napoleon
did
not
let
him
speak.
He
evidently
wanted
to
do
all
the
talking
himself,
and
continued
to
talk
with
the
sort
of
eloquence
and
unrestrained
irritability
to
which
spoiled
people
are
so
prone.
"Yes,
I
know
you
have
made
peace
with
the
Turks
without
obtaining
Moldavia
and
Wallachia;
I
would
have
given
your
sovereign
those
provinces
as
I
gave
him
Finland.
Yes,"
he
went
on,
"I
promised
and
would
have
given
the
Emperor
Alexander
Moldavia
and
Wallachia,
and
now
he
won't
have
those
splendid
provinces.
Yet
he
might
have
united
them
to
his
empire
and
in
a
single
reign
would
have
extended
Russia
from
the
Gulf
of
Bothnia
to
the
mouths
of
the
Danube.
Catherine
the
Great
could
not
have
done
more,"
said
Napoleon,
growing
more
and
more
excited
as
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room,
repeating
to
Balashev
almost
the
very
words
he
had
used
to
Alexander
himself
at
Tilsit.
"All
that,
he
would
have
owed
to
my
friendship.
Oh,
what
a
splendid
reign!"
he
repeated
several
times,
then
paused,
drew
from
his
pocket
a
gold
snuffbox,
lifted
it
to
his
nose,
and
greedily
sniffed
at
it.
"What
a
splendid
reign
the
Emperor
Alexander's
might
have
been!"
He
looked
compassionately
at
Balashev,
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
tried
to
make
some
rejoinder
hastily
interrupted
him.
"What
could
he
wish
or
look
for
that
he
would
not
have
obtained
through
my
friendship?"
demanded
Napoleon,
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
perplexity.
"But
no,
he
has
preferred
to
surround
himself
with
my
enemies,
and
with
whom?
With
Steins,
Armfeldts,
Bennigsens,
and
Wintzingerodes!
Stein,
a
traitor
expelled
from
his
own
country;
Armfeldt,
a
rake
and
an
intriguer;
Wintzingerode,
a
fugitive
French
subject;
Bennigsen,
rather
more
of
a
soldier
than
the
others,
but
all
the
same
an
incompetent
who
was
unable
to
do
anything
in
1807
and
who
should
awaken
terrible
memories
in
the
Emperor
Alexander's
mind....
Granted
that
were
they
competent
they
might
be
made
use
of,"
continued
Napoleon--hardly
able
to
keep
pace
in
words
with
the
rush
of
thoughts
that
incessantly
sprang
up,
proving
how
right
and
strong
he
was
(in
his
perception
the
two
were
one
and
the
same)--"but
they
are
not
even
that!
They
are
neither
fit
for
war
nor
peace!
Barclay
is
said
to
be
the
most
capable
of
them
all,
but
I
cannot
say
so,
judging
by
his
first
movements.
And
what
are
they
doing,
all
these
courtiers?
Pfuel
proposes,
Armfeldt
disputes,
Bennigsen
considers,
and
Barclay,
called
on
to
act,
does
not
know
what
to
decide
on,
and
time
passes
bringing
no
result.
Bagration
alone
is
a
military
man.
He's
stupid,
but
he
has
experience,
a
quick
eye,
and
resolution....
And
what
role
is
your
young
monarch
playing
in
that
monstrous
crowd?
They
compromise
him
and
throw
on
him
the
responsibility
for
all
that
happens.
A
sovereign
should
not
be
with
the
army
unless
he
is
a
general!"
said
Napoleon,
evidently
uttering
these
words
as
a
direct
challenge
to
the
Emperor.
He
knew
how
Alexander
desired
to
be
a
military
commander.
"The
campaign
began
only
a
week
ago,
and
you
haven't
even
been
able
to
defend
Vilna.
You
are
cut
in
two
and
have
been
driven
out
of
the
Polish
provinces.
Your
army
is
grumbling."
"On
the
contrary,
Your
Majesty,"
said
Balashev,
hardly
able
to
remember
what
had
been
said
to
him
and
following
these
verbal
fireworks
with
difficulty,
"the
troops
are
burning
with
eagerness..."
"I
know
everything!"
Napoleon
interrupted
him.
"I
know
everything.
I
know
the
number
of
your
battalions
as
exactly
as
I
know
my
own.
You
have
not
two
hundred
thousand
men,
and
I
have
three
times
that
number.
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor,"
said
Napoleon,
forgetting
that
his
word
of
honor
could
carry
no
weight--"I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
I
have
five
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
men
this
side
of
the
Vistula.
The
Turks
will
be
of
no
use
to
you;
they
are
worth
nothing
and
have
shown
it
by
making
peace
with
you.
As
for
the
Swedes--it
is
their
fate
to
be
governed
by
mad
kings.
Their
king
was
insane
and
they
changed
him
for
another--
Bernadotte,
who
promptly
went
mad--for
no
Swede
would
ally
himself
with
Russia
unless
he
were
mad."
Napoleon
grinned
maliciously
and
again
raised
his
snuffbox
to
his
nose.
Balashev
knew
how
to
reply
to
each
of
Napoleon's
remarks,
and
would
have
done
so;
he
continually
made
the
gesture
of
a
man
wishing
to
say
something,
but
Napoleon
always
interrupted
him.
To
the
alleged
insanity
of
the
Swedes,
Balashev
wished
to
reply
that
when
Russia
is
on
her
side
Sweden
is
practically
an
island:
but
Napoleon
gave
an
angry
exclamation
to
drown
his
voice.
Napoleon
was
in
that
state
of
irritability
in
which
a
man
has
to
talk,
talk,
and
talk,
merely
to
convince
himself
that
he
is
in
the
right.
Balashev
began
to
feel
uncomfortable:
as
envoy
he
feared
to
demean
his
dignity
and
felt
the
necessity
of
replying;
but,
as
a
man,
he
shrank
before
the
transport
of
groundless
wrath
that
had
evidently
seized
Napoleon.
He
knew
that
none
of
the
words
now
uttered
by
Napoleon
had
any
significance,
and
that
Napoleon
himself
would
be
ashamed
of
them
when
he
came
to
his
senses.
Balashev
stood
with
downcast
eyes,
looking
at
the
movements
of
Napoleon's
stout
legs
and
trying
to
avoid
meeting
his
eyes.
"But
what
do
I
care
about
your
allies?"
said
Napoleon.
"I
have
allies--
the
Poles.
There
are
eighty
thousand
of
them
and
they
fight
like
lions.
And
there
will
be
two
hundred
thousand
of
them."
And
probably
still
more
perturbed
by
the
fact
that
he
had
uttered
this
obvious
falsehood,
and
that
Balashev
still
stood
silently
before
him
in
the
same
attitude
of
submission
to
fate,
Napoleon
abruptly
turned
round,
drew
close
to
Balashev's
face,
and,
gesticulating
rapidly
and
energetically
with
his
white
hands,
almost
shouted:
"Know
that
if
you
stir
up
Prussia
against
me,
I'll
wipe
it
off
the
map
of
Europe!"
he
declared,
his
face
pale
and
distorted
by
anger,
and
he
struck
one
of
his
small
hands
energetically
with
the
other.
"Yes,
I
will
throw
you
back
beyond
the
Dvina
and
beyond
the
Dnieper,
and
will
re-
erect
against
you
that
barrier
which
it
was
criminal
and
blind
of
Europe
to
allow
to
be
destroyed.
Yes,
that
is
what
will
happen
to
you.
That
is
what
you
have
gained
by
alienating
me!"
And
he
walked
silently
several
times
up
and
down
the
room,
his
fat
shoulders
twitching.
He
put
his
snuffbox
into
his
waistcoat
pocket,
took
it
out
again,
lifted
it
several
times
to
his
nose,
and
stopped
in
front
of
Balashev.
He
paused,
looked
ironically
straight
into
Balashev's
eyes,
and
said
in
a
quiet
voice:
"And
yet
what
a
splendid
reign
your
master
might
have
had!"
Balashev,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
him
to
reply,
said
that
from
the
Russian
side
things
did
not
appear
in
so
gloomy
a
light.
Napoleon
was
silent,
still
looking
derisively
at
him
and
evidently
not
listening
to
him.
Balashev
said
that
in
Russia
the
best
results
were
expected
from
the
war.
Napoleon
nodded
condescendingly,
as
if
to
say,
"I
know
it's
your
duty
to
say
that,
but
you
don't
believe
it
yourself.
I
have
convinced
you."
When
Balashev
had
ended,
Napoleon
again
took
out
his
snuffbox,
sniffed
at
it,
and
stamped
his
foot
twice
on
the
floor
as
a
signal.
The
door
opened,
a
gentleman-in-waiting,
bending
respectfully,
handed
the
Emperor
his
hat
and
gloves;
another
brought
him
a
pocket
handkerchief.
Napoleon,
without
giving
them
a
glance,
turned
to
Balashev:
"Assure
the
Emperor
Alexander
from
me,"
said
he,
taking
his
hat,
"that
I
am
as
devoted
to
him
as
before:
I
know
him
thoroughly
and
very
highly
esteem
his
lofty
qualities.
I
will
detain
you
no
longer,
General;
you
shall
receive
my
letter
to
the
Emperor."
And
Napoleon
went
quickly
to
the
door.
Everyone
in
the
reception
room
rushed
forward
and
descended
the
staircase.
CHAPTER
VII
After
all
that
Napoleon
had
said
to
him--those
bursts
of
anger
and
the
last
dryly
spoken
words:
"I
will
detain
you
no
longer,
General;
you
shall
receive
my
letter,"
Balashev
felt
convinced
that
Napoleon
would
not
wish
to
see
him,
and
would
even
avoid
another
meeting
with
him--an
insulted
envoy--especially
as
he
had
witnessed
his
unseemly
anger.
But,
to
his
surprise,
Balashev
received,
through
Duroc,
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
Emperor
that
day.
Bessieres,
Caulaincourt,
and
Berthier
were
present
at
that
dinner.
Napoleon
met
Balashev
cheerfully
and
amiably.
He
not
only
showed
no
sign
of
constraint
or
self-reproach
on
account
of
his
outburst
that
morning,
but,
on
the
contrary,
tried
to
reassure
Balashev.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
long
been
convinced
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
mistake,
and
that
in
his
perception
whatever
he
did
was
right,
not
because
it
harmonized
with
any
idea
of
right
and
wrong,
but
because
he
did
it.
The
Emperor
was
in
very
good
spirits
after
his
ride
through
Vilna,
where
crowds
of
people
had
rapturously
greeted
and
followed
him.
From
all
the
windows
of
the
streets
through
which
he
rode,
rugs,
flags,
and
his
monogram
were
displayed,
and
the
Polish
ladies,
welcoming
him,
waved
their
handkerchiefs
to
him.
At
dinner,
having
placed
Balashev
beside
him,
Napoleon
not
only
treated
him
amiably
but
behaved
as
if
Balashev
were
one
of
his
own
courtiers,
one
of
those
who
sympathized
with
his
plans
and
ought
to
rejoice
at
his
success.
In
the
course
of
conversation
he
mentioned
Moscow
and
questioned
Balashev
about
the
Russian
capital,
not
merely
as
an
interested
traveler
asks
about
a
new
city
he
intends
to
visit,
but
as
if
convinced
that
Balashev,
as
a
Russian,
must
be
flattered
by
his
curiosity.
"How
many
inhabitants
are
there
in
Moscow?
How
many
houses?
Is
it
true
that
Moscow
is
called
'Holy
Moscow'?
How
many
churches
are
there
in
Moscow?"
he
asked.
And
receiving
the
reply
that
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
churches,
he
remarked:
"Why
such
a
quantity
of
churches?"
"The
Russians
are
very
devout,"
replied
Balashev.
"But
a
large
number
of
monasteries
and
churches
is
always
a
sign
of
the
backwardness
of
a
people,"
said
Napoleon,
turning
to
Caulaincourt
for
appreciation
of
this
remark.
Balashev
respectfully
ventured
to
disagree
with
the
French
Emperor.
"Every
country
has
its
own
character,"
said
he.
"But
nowhere
in
Europe
is
there
anything
like
that,"
said
Napoleon.
"I
beg
your
Majesty's
pardon,"
returned
Balashev,
"besides
Russia
there
is
Spain,
where
there
are
also
many
churches
and
monasteries."
This
reply
of
Balashev's,
which
hinted
at
the
recent
defeats
of
the
French
in
Spain,
was
much
appreciated
when
he
related
it
at
Alexander's
court,
but
it
was
not
much
appreciated
at
Napoleon's
dinner,
where
it
passed
unnoticed.
The
uninterested
and
perplexed
faces
of
the
marshals
showed
that
they
were
puzzled
as
to
what
Balashev's
tone
suggested.
"If
there
is
a
point
we
don't
see
it,
or
it
is
not
at
all
witty,"
their
expressions
seemed
to
say.
So
little
was
his
rejoinder
appreciated
that
Napoleon
did
not
notice
it
at
all
and
naively
asked
Balashev
through
what
towns
the
direct
road
from
there
to
Moscow
passed.
Balashev,
who
was
on
the
alert
all
through
the
dinner,
replied
that
just
as
"all
roads
lead
to
Rome,"
so
all
roads
lead
to
Moscow:
there
were
many
roads,
and
"among
them
the
road
through
Poltava,
which
Charles
XII
chose."
Balashev
involuntarily
flushed
with
pleasure
at
the
aptitude
of
this
reply,
but
hardly
had
he
uttered
the
word
Poltava
before
Caulaincourt
began
speaking
of
the
badness
of
the
road
from
Petersburg
to
Moscow
and
of
his
Petersburg
reminiscences.
After
dinner
they
went
to
drink
coffee
in
Napoleon's
study,
which
four
days
previously
had
been
that
of
the
Emperor
Alexander.
Napoleon
sat
down,
toying
with
his
Sevres
coffee
cup,
and
motioned
Balashev
to
a
chair
beside
him.
Napoleon
was
in
that
well-known
after-dinner
mood
which,
more
than
any
reasoned
cause,
makes
a
man
contented
with
himself
and
disposed
to
consider
everyone
his
friend.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
surrounded
by
men
who
adored
him:
and
he
felt
convinced
that,
after
his
dinner,
Balashev
too
was
his
friend
and
worshiper.
Napoleon
turned
to
him
with
a
pleasant,
though
slightly
ironic,
smile.
"They
tell
me
this
is
the
room
the
Emperor
Alexander
occupied?
Strange,
isn't
it,
General?"
he
said,
evidently
not
doubting
that
this
remark
would
be
agreeable
to
his
hearer
since
it
went
to
prove
his,
Napoleon's,
superiority
to
Alexander.
Balashev
made
no
reply
and
bowed
his
head
in
silence.
"Yes.
Four
days
ago
in
this
room,
Wintzingerode
and
Stein
were
deliberating,"
continued
Napoleon
with
the
same
derisive
and
self-
confident
smile.
"What
I
can't
understand,"
he
went
on,
"is
that
the
Emperor
Alexander
has
surrounded
himself
with
my
personal
enemies.
That
I
do
not...
understand.
Has
he
not
thought
that
I
may
do
the
same?"
and
he
turned
inquiringly
to
Balashev,
and
evidently
this
thought
turned
him
back
on
to
the
track
of
his
morning's
anger,
which
was
still
fresh
in
him.
"And
let
him
know
that
I
will
do
so!"
said
Napoleon,
rising
and
pushing
his
cup
away
with
his
hand.
"I'll
drive
all
his
Wurttemberg,
Baden,
and
Weimar
relations
out
of
Germany....
Yes.
I'll
drive
them
out.
Let
him
prepare
an
asylum
for
them
in
Russia!"
Balashev
bowed
his
head
with
an
air
indicating
that
he
would
like
to
make
his
bow
and
leave,
and
only
listened
because
he
could
not
help
hearing
what
was
said
to
him.
Napoleon
did
not
notice
this
expression;
he
treated
Balashev
not
as
an
envoy
from
his
enemy,
but
as
a
man
now
fully
devoted
to
him
and
who
must
rejoice
at
his
former
master's
humiliation.
"And
why
has
the
Emperor
Alexander
taken
command
of
the
armies?
What
is
the
good
of
that?
War
is
my
profession,
but
his
business
is
to
reign
and
not
to
command
armies!
Why
has
he
taken
on
himself
such
a
responsibility?"
Again
Napoleon
brought
out
his
snuffbox,
paced
several
times
up
and
down
the
room
in
silence,
and
then,
suddenly
and
unexpectedly,
went
up
to
Balashev
and
with
a
slight
smile,
as
confidently,
quickly,
and
simply
as
if
he
were
doing
something
not
merely
important
but
pleasing
to
Balashev,
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
forty-year-old
Russian
general's
face
and,
taking
him
by
the
ear,
pulled
it
gently,
smiling
with
his
lips
only.
To
have
one's
ear
pulled
by
the
Emperor
was
considered
the
greatest
honor
and
mark
of
favor
at
the
French
court.
"Well,
adorer
and
courtier
of
the
Emperor
Alexander,
why
don't
you
say
anything?"
said
he,
as
if
it
was
ridiculous,
in
his
presence,
to
be
the
adorer
and
courtier
of
anyone
but
himself,
Napoleon.
"Are
the
horses
ready
for
the
general?"
he
added,
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
in
reply
to
Balashev's
bow.
"Let
him
have
mine,
he
has
a
long
way
to
go!"
The
letter
taken
by
Balashev
was
the
last
Napoleon
sent
to
Alexander.
Every
detail
of
the
interview
was
communicated
to
the
Russian
monarch,
and
the
war
began...
CHAPTER
VIII
After
his
interview
with
Pierre
in
Moscow,
Prince
Andrew
went
to
Petersburg,
on
business
as
he
told
his
family,
but
really
to
meet
Anatole
Kuragin
whom
he
felt
it
necessary
to
encounter.
On
reaching
Petersburg
he
inquired
for
Kuragin
but
the
latter
had
already
left
the
city.
Pierre
had
warned
his
brother-in-law
that
Prince
Andrew
was
on
his
track.
Anatole
Kuragin
promptly
obtained
an
appointment
from
the
Minister
of
War
and
went
to
join
the
army
in
Moldavia.
While
in
Petersburg
Prince
Andrew
met
Kutuzov,
his
former
commander
who
was
always
well
disposed
toward
him,
and
Kutuzov
suggested
that
he
should
accompany
him
to
the
army
in
Moldavia,
to
which
the
old
general
had
been
appointed
commander-in-chief.
So
Prince
Andrew,
having
received
an
appointment
on
the
headquarters
staff,
left
for
Turkey.
Prince
Andrew
did
not
think
it
proper
to
write
and
challenge
Kuragin.
He
thought
that
if
he
challenged
him
without
some
fresh
cause
it
might
compromise
the
young
Countess
Rostova
and
so
he
wanted
to
meet
Kuragin
personally
in
order
to
find
a
fresh
pretext
for
a
duel.
But
he
again
failed
to
meet
Kuragin
in
Turkey,
for
soon
after
Prince
Andrew
arrived,
the
latter
returned
to
Russia.
In
a
new
country,
amid
new
conditions,
Prince
Andrew
found
life
easier
to
bear.
After
his
betrothed
had
broken
faith
with
him--which
he
felt
the
more
acutely
the
more
he
tried
to
conceal
its
effects--the
surroundings
in
which
he
had
been
happy
became
trying
to
him,
and
the
freedom
and
independence
he
had
once
prized
so
highly
were
still
more
so.
Not
only
could
he
no
longer
think
the
thoughts
that
had
first
come
to
him
as
he
lay
gazing
at
the
sky
on
the
field
of
Austerlitz
and
had
later
enlarged
upon
with
Pierre,
and
which
had
filled
his
solitude
at
Bogucharovo
and
then
in
Switzerland
and
Rome,
but
he
even
dreaded
to
recall
them
and
the
bright
and
boundless
horizons
they
had
revealed.
He
was
now
concerned
only
with
the
nearest
practical
matters
unrelated
to
his
past
interests,
and
he
seized
on
these
the
more
eagerly
the
more
those
past
interests
were
closed
to
him.
It
was
as
if
that
lofty,
infinite
canopy
of
heaven
that
had
once
towered
above
him
had
suddenly
turned
into
a
low,
solid
vault
that
weighed
him
down,
in
which
all
was
clear,
but
nothing
eternal
or
mysterious.
Of
the
activities
that
presented
themselves
to
him,
army
service
was
the
simplest
and
most
familiar.
As
a
general
on
duty
on
Kutuzov's
staff,
he
applied
himself
to
business
with
zeal
and
perseverance
and
surprised
Kutuzov
by
his
willingness
and
accuracy
in
work.
Not
having
found
Kuragin
in
Turkey,
Prince
Andrew
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
rush
back
to
Russia
after
him,
but
all
the
same
he
knew
that
however
long
it
might
be
before
he
met
Kuragin,
despite
his
contempt
for
him
and
despite
all
the
proofs
he
deduced
to
convince
himself
that
it
was
not
worth
stooping
to
a
conflict
with
him--he
knew
that
when
he
did
meet
him
he
would
not
be
able
to
resist
calling
him
out,
any
more
than
a
ravenous
man
can
help
snatching
at
food.
And
the
consciousness
that
the
insult
was
not
yet
avenged,
that
his
rancor
was
still
unspent,
weighed
on
his
heart
and
poisoned
the
artificial
tranquillity
which
he
managed
to
obtain
in
Turkey
by
means
of
restless,
plodding,
and
rather
vainglorious
and
ambitious
activity.
In
the
year
1812,
when
news
of
the
war
with
Napoleon
reached
Bucharest--
where
Kutuzov
had
been
living
for
two
months,
passing
his
days
and
nights
with
a
Wallachian
woman--Prince
Andrew
asked
Kutuzov
to
transfer
him
to
the
Western
Army.
Kutuzov,
who
was
already
weary
of
Bolkonski's
activity
which
seemed
to
reproach
his
own
idleness,
very
readily
let
him
go
and
gave
him
a
mission
to
Barclay
de
Tolly.
Before
joining
the
Western
Army
which
was
then,
in
May,
encamped
at
Drissa,
Prince
Andrew
visited
Bald
Hills
which
was
directly
on
his
way,
being
only
two
miles
off
the
Smolensk
highroad.
During
the
last
three
years
there
had
been
so
many
changes
in
his
life,
he
had
thought,
felt,
and
seen
so
much
(having
traveled
both
in
the
east
and
the
west),
that
on
reaching
Bald
Hills
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
unexpected
to
find
the
way
of
life
there
unchanged
and
still
the
same
in
every
detail.
He
entered
through
the
gates
with
their
stone
pillars
and
drove
up
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
as
if
he
were
entering
an
enchanted,
sleeping
castle.
The
same
old
stateliness,
the
same
cleanliness,
the
same
stillness
reigned
there,
and
inside
there
was
the
same
furniture,
the
same
walls,
sounds,
and
smell,
and
the
same
timid
faces,
only
somewhat
older.
Princess
Mary
was
still
the
same
timid,
plain
maiden
getting
on
in
years,
uselessly
and
joylessly
passing
the
best
years
of
her
life
in
fear
and
constant
suffering.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
was
the
same
coquettish,
self-satisfied
girl,
enjoying
every
moment
of
her
existence
and
full
of
joyous
hopes
for
the
future.
She
had
merely
become
more
self-confident,
Prince
Andrew
thought.
Dessalles,
the
tutor
he
had
brought
from
Switzerland,
was
wearing
a
coat
of
Russian
cut
and
talking
broken
Russian
to
the
servants,
but
was
still
the
same
narrowly
intelligent,
conscientious,
and
pedantic
preceptor.
The
old
prince
had
changed
in
appearance
only
by
the
loss
of
a
tooth,
which
left
a
noticeable
gap
on
one
side
of
his
mouth;
in
character
he
was
the
same
as
ever,
only
showing
still
more
irritability
and
skepticism
as
to
what
was
happening
in
the
world.
Little
Nicholas
alone
had
changed.
He
had
grown,
become
rosier,
had
curly
dark
hair,
and,
when
merry
and
laughing,
quite
unconsciously
lifted
the
upper
lip
of
his
pretty
little
mouth
just
as
the
little
princess
used
to
do.
He
alone
did
not
obey
the
law
of
immutability
in
the
enchanted,
sleeping
castle.
But
though
externally
all
remained
as
of
old,
the
inner
relations
of
all
these
people
had
changed
since
Prince
Andrew
had
seen
them
last.
The
household
was
divided
into
two
alien
and
hostile
camps,
who
changed
their
habits
for
his
sake
and
only
met
because
he
was
there.
To
the
one
camp
belonged
the
old
prince,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
and
the
architect;
to
the
other
Princess
Mary,
Dessalles,
little
Nicholas,
and
all
the
old
nurses
and
maids.
During
his
stay
at
Bald
Hills
all
the
family
dined
together,
but
they
were
ill
at
ease
and
Prince
Andrew
felt
that
he
was
a
visitor
for
whose
sake
an
exception
was
being
made
and
that
his
presence
made
them
all
feel
awkward.
Involuntarily
feeling
this
at
dinner
on
the
first
day,
he
was
taciturn,
and
the
old
prince
noticing
this
also
became
morosely
dumb
and
retired
to
his
apartments
directly
after
dinner.
In
the
evening,
when
Prince
Andrew
went
to
him
and,
trying
to
rouse
him,
began
to
tell
him
of
the
young
Count
Kamensky's
campaign,
the
old
prince
began
unexpectedly
to
talk
about
Princess
Mary,
blaming
her
for
her
superstitions
and
her
dislike
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
who,
he
said,
was
the
only
person
really
attached
to
him.
The
old
prince
said
that
if
he
was
ill
it
was
only
because
of
Princess
Mary:
that
she
purposely
worried
and
irritated
him,
and
that
by
indulgence
and
silly
talk
she
was
spoiling
little
Prince
Nicholas.
The
old
prince
knew
very
well
that
he
tormented
his
daughter
and
that
her
life
was
very
hard,
but
he
also
knew
that
he
could
not
help
tormenting
her
and
that
she
deserved
it.
"Why
does
Prince
Andrew,
who
sees
this,
say
nothing
to
me
about
his
sister?
Does
he
think
me
a
scoundrel,
or
an
old
fool
who,
without
any
reason,
keeps
his
own
daughter
at
a
distance
and
attaches
this
Frenchwoman
to
himself?
He
doesn't
understand,
so
I
must
explain
it,
and
he
must
hear
me
out,"
thought
the
old
prince.
And
he
began
explaining
why
he
could
not
put
up
with
his
daughter's
unreasonable
character.
"If
you
ask
me,"
said
Prince
Andrew,
without
looking
up
(he
was
censuring
his
father
for
the
first
time
in
his
life),
"I
did
not
wish
to
speak
about
it,
but
as
you
ask
me
I
will
give
you
my
frank
opinion.
If
there
is
any
misunderstanding
and
discord
between
you
and
Mary,
I
can't
blame
her
for
it
at
all.
I
know
how
she
loves
and
respects
you.
Since
you
ask
me,"
continued
Prince
Andrew,
becoming
irritable--as
he
was
always
liable
to
do
of
late--"I
can
only
say
that
if
there
are
any
misunderstandings
they
are
caused
by
that
worthless
woman,
who
is
not
fit
to
be
my
sister's
companion."
The
old
man
at
first
stared
fixedly
at
his
son,
and
an
unnatural
smile
disclosed
the
fresh
gap
between
his
teeth
to
which
Prince
Andrew
could
not
get
accustomed.
"What
companion,
my
dear
boy?
Eh?
You've
already
been
talking
it
over!
Eh?"
"Father,
I
did
not
want
to
judge,"
said
Prince
Andrew,
in
a
hard
and
bitter
tone,
"but
you
challenged
me,
and
I
have
said,
and
always
shall
say,
that
Mary
is
not
to
blame,
but
those
to
blame--the
one
to
blame--is
that
Frenchwoman."
"Ah,
he
has
passed
judgment...
passed
judgement!"
said
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
and,
as
it
seemed
to
Prince
Andrew,
with
some
embarrassment,
but
then
he
suddenly
jumped
up
and
cried:
"Be
off,
be
off!
Let
not
a
trace
of
you
remain
here!..."
Prince
Andrew
wished
to
leave
at
once,
but
Princess
Mary
persuaded
him
to
stay
another
day.
That
day
he
did
not
see
his
father,
who
did
not
leave
his
room
and
admitted
no
one
but
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
Tikhon,
but
asked
several
times
whether
his
son
had
gone.
Next
day,
before
leaving,
Prince
Andrew
went
to
his
son's
rooms.
The
boy,
curly-
headed
like
his
mother
and
glowing
with
health,
sat
on
his
knee,
and
Prince
Andrew
began
telling
him
the
story
of
Bluebeard,
but
fell
into
a
reverie
without
finishing
the
story.
He
thought
not
of
this
pretty
child,
his
son
whom
he
held
on
his
knee,
but
of
himself.
He
sought
in
himself
either
remorse
for
having
angered
his
father
or
regret
at
leaving
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
on
bad
terms
with
him,
and
was
horrified
to
find
neither.
What
meant
still
more
to
him
was
that
he
sought
and
did
not
find
in
himself
the
former
tenderness
for
his
son
which
he
had
hoped
to
reawaken
by
caressing
the
boy
and
taking
him
on
his
knee.
"Well,
go
on!"
said
his
son.
Prince
Andrew,
without
replying,
put
him
down
from
his
knee
and
went
out
of
the
room.
As
soon
as
Prince
Andrew
had
given
up
his
daily
occupations,
and
especially
on
returning
to
the
old
conditions
of
life
amid
which
he
had
been
happy,
weariness
of
life
overcame
him
with
its
former
intensity,
and
he
hastened
to
escape
from
these
memories
and
to
find
some
work
as
soon
as
possible.
"So
you've
decided
to
go,
Andrew?"
asked
his
sister.
"Thank
God
that
I
can,"
replied
Prince
Andrew.
"I
am
very
sorry
you
can't."
"Why
do
you
say
that?"
replied
Princess
Mary.
"Why
do
you
say
that,
when
you
are
going
to
this
terrible
war,
and
he
is
so
old?
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
says
he
has
been
asking
about
you...."
As
soon
as
she
began
to
speak
of
that,
her
lips
trembled
and
her
tears
began
to
fall.
Prince
Andrew
turned
away
and
began
pacing
the
room.
"Ah,
my
God!
my
God!
When
one
thinks
who
and
what--what
trash--can
cause
people
misery!"
he
said
with
a
malignity
that
alarmed
Princess
Mary.
She
understood
that
when
speaking
of
"trash"
he
referred
not
only
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
the
cause
of
her
misery,
but
also
to
the
man
who
had
ruined
his
own
happiness.
"Andrew!
One
thing
I
beg,
I
entreat
of
you!"
she
said,
touching
his
elbow
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
shone
through
her
tears.
"I
understand
you"
(she
looked
down).
"Don't
imagine
that
sorrow
is
the
work
of
men.
Men
are
His
tools."
She
looked
a
little
above
Prince
Andrew's
head
with
the
confident,
accustomed
look
with
which
one
looks
at
the
place
where
a
familiar
portrait
hangs.
"Sorrow
is
sent
by
Him,
not
by
men.
Men
are
His
instruments,
they
are
not
to
blame.
If
you
think
someone
has
wronged
you,
forget
it
and
forgive!
We
have
no
right
to
punish.
And
then
you
will
know
the
happiness
of
forgiving."
"If
I
were
a
woman
I
would
do
so,
Mary.
That
is
a
woman's
virtue.
But
a
man
should
not
and
cannot
forgive
and
forget,"
he
replied,
and
though
till
that
moment
he
had
not
been
thinking
of
Kuragin,
all
his
unexpended
anger
suddenly
swelled
up
in
his
heart.
"If
Mary
is
already
persuading
me
to
forgive,
it
means
that
I
ought
long
ago
to
have
punished
him,"
he
thought.
And
giving
her
no
further
reply,
he
began
thinking
of
the
glad
vindictive
moment
when
he
would
meet
Kuragin
who
he
knew
was
now
in
the
army.
Princess
Mary
begged
him
to
stay
one
day
more,
saying
that
she
knew
how
unhappy
her
father
would
be
if
Andrew
left
without
being
reconciled
to
him,
but
Prince
Andrew
replied
that
he
would
probably
soon
be
back
again
from
the
army
and
would
certainly
write
to
his
father,
but
that
the
longer
he
stayed
now
the
more
embittered
their
differences
would
become.
"Good-bye,
Andrew!
Remember
that
misfortunes
come
from
God,
and
men
are
never
to
blame,"
were
the
last
words
he
heard
from
his
sister
when
he
took
leave
of
her.
"Then
it
must
be
so!"
thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
drove
out
of
the
avenue
from
the
house
at
Bald
Hills.
"She,
poor
innocent
creature,
is
left
to
be
victimized
by
an
old
man
who
has
outlived
his
wits.
The
old
man
feels
he
is
guilty,
but
cannot
change
himself.
My
boy
is
growing
up
and
rejoices
in
life,
in
which
like
everybody
else
he
will
deceive
or
be
deceived.
And
I
am
off
to
the
army.
Why?
I
myself
don't
know.
I
want
to
meet
that
man
whom
I
despise,
so
as
to
give
him
a
chance
to
kill
and
laugh
at
me!"
These
conditions
of
life
had
been
the
same
before,
but
then
they
were
all
connected,
while
now
they
had
all
tumbled
to
pieces.
Only
senseless
things,
lacking
coherence,
presented
themselves
one
after
another
to
Prince
Andrew's
mind.
CHAPTER
IX
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
general
headquarters
of
the
army
at
the
end
of
June.
The
first
army,
with
which
was
the
Emperor,
occupied
the
fortified
camp
at
Drissa;
the
second
army
was
retreating,
trying
to
effect
a
junction
with
the
first
one
from
which
it
was
said
to
be
cut
off
by
large
French
forces.
Everyone
was
dissatisfied
with
the
general
course
of
affairs
in
the
Russian
army,
but
no
one
anticipated
any
danger
of
invasion
of
the
Russian
provinces,
and
no
one
thought
the
war
would
extend
farther
than
the
western,
the
Polish,
provinces.
Prince
Andrew
found
Barclay
de
Tolly,
to
whom
he
had
been
assigned,
on
the
bank
of
the
Drissa.
As
there
was
not
a
single
town
or
large
village
in
the
vicinity
of
the
camp,
the
immense
number
of
generals
and
courtiers
accompanying
the
army
were
living
in
the
best
houses
of
the
villages
on
both
sides
of
the
river,
over
a
radius
of
six
miles.
Barclay
de
Tolly
was
quartered
nearly
three
miles
from
the
Emperor.
He
received
Bolkonski
stiffly
and
coldly
and
told
him
in
his
foreign
accent
that
he
would
mention
him
to
the
Emperor
for
a
decision
as
to
his
employment,
but
asked
him
meanwhile
to
remain
on
his
staff.
Anatole
Kuragin,
whom
Prince
Andrew
had
hoped
to
find
with
the
army,
was
not
there.
He
had
gone
to
Petersburg,
but
Prince
Andrew
was
glad
to
hear
this.
His
mind
was
occupied
by
the
interests
of
the
center
that
was
conducting
a
gigantic
war,
and
he
was
glad
to
be
free
for
a
while
from
the
distraction
caused
by
the
thought
of
Kuragin.
During
the
first
four
days,
while
no
duties
were
required
of
him,
Prince
Andrew
rode
round
the
whole
fortified
camp
and,
by
the
aid
of
his
own
knowledge
and
by
talks
with
experts,
tried
to
form
a
definite
opinion
about
it.
But
the
question
whether
the
camp
was
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
remained
for
him
undecided.
Already
from
his
military
experience
and
what
he
had
seen
in
the
Austrian
campaign,
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
war
the
most
deeply
considered
plans
have
no
significance
and
that
all
depends
on
the
way
unexpected
movements
of
the
enemy--that
cannot
be
foreseen--are
met,
and
on
how
and
by
whom
the
whole
matter
is
handled.
To
clear
up
this
last
point
for
himself,
Prince
Andrew,
utilizing
his
position
and
acquaintances,
tried
to
fathom
the
character
of
the
control
of
the
army
and
of
the
men
and
parties
engaged
in
it,
and
he
deduced
for
himself
the
following
of
the
state
of
affairs.
While
the
Emperor
had
still
been
at
Vilna,
the
forces
had
been
divided
into
three
armies.
First,
the
army
under
Barclay
de
Tolly,
secondly,
the
army
under
Bagration,
and
thirdly,
the
one
commanded
by
Tormasov.
The
Emperor
was
with
the
first
army,
but
not
as
commander-in-chief.
In
the
orders
issued
it
was
stated,
not
that
the
Emperor
would
take
command,
but
only
that
he
would
be
with
the
army.
The
Emperor,
moreover,
had
with
him
not
a
commander-in-chief's
staff
but
the
imperial
headquarters
staff.
In
attendance
on
him
was
the
head
of
the
imperial
staff,
Quartermaster
General
Prince
Volkonski,
as
well
as
generals,
imperial
aides-de-camp,
diplomatic
officials,
and
a
large
number
of
foreigners,
but
not
the
army
staff.
Besides
these,
there
were
in
attendance
on
the
Emperor
without
any
definite
appointments:
Arakcheev,
the
ex-Minister
of
War;
Count
Bennigsen,
the
senior
general
in
rank;
the
Grand
Duke
Tsarevich
Constantine
Pavlovich;
Count
Rumyantsev,
the
Chancellor;
Stein,
a
former
Prussian
minister;
Armfeldt,
a
Swedish
general;
Pfuel,
the
chief
author
of
the
plan
of
campaign;
Paulucci,
an
adjutant
general
and
Sardinian
emigre;
Wolzogen--and
many
others.
Though
these
men
had
no
military
appointment
in
the
army,
their
position
gave
them
influence,
and
often
a
corps
commander,
or
even
the
commander-in-chief,
did
not
know
in
what
capacity
he
was
questioned
by
Bennigsen,
the
Grand
Duke,
Arakcheev,
or
Prince
Volkonski,
or
was
given
this
or
that
advice
and
did
not
know
whether
a
certain
order
received
in
the
form
of
advice
emanated
from
the
man
who
gave
it
or
from
the
Emperor
and
whether
it
had
to
be
executed
or
not.
But
this
was
only
the
external
condition;
the
essential
significance
of
the
presence
of
the
Emperor
and
of
all
these
people,
from
a
courtier's
point
of
view
(and
in
an
Emperor's
vicinity
all
became
courtiers),
was
clear
to
everyone.
It
was
this:
the
Emperor
did
not
assume
the
title
of
commander-in-chief,
but
disposed
of
all
the
armies;
the
men
around
him
were
his
assistants.
Arakcheev
was
a
faithful
custodian
to
enforce
order
and
acted
as
the
sovereign's
bodyguard.
Bennigsen
was
a
landlord
in
the
Vilna
province
who
appeared
to
be
doing
the
honors
of
the
district,
but
was
in
reality
a
good
general,
useful
as
an
adviser
and
ready
at
hand
to
replace
Barclay.
The
Grand
Duke
was
there
because
it
suited
him
to
be.
The
ex-Minister
Stein
was
there
because
his
advice
was
useful
and
the
Emperor
Alexander
held
him
in
high
esteem
personally.
Armfeldt
virulently
hated
Napoleon
and
was
a
general
full
of
self-confidence,
a
quality
that
always
influenced
Alexander.
Paulucci
was
there
because
he
was
bold
and
decided
in
speech.
The
adjutants
general
were
there
because
they
always
accompanied
the
Emperor,
and
lastly
and
chiefly
Pfuel
was
there
because
he
had
drawn
up
the
plan
of
campaign
against
Napoleon
and,
having
induced
Alexander
to
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
that
plan,
was
directing
the
whole
business
of
the
war.
With
Pfuel
was
Wolzogen,
who
expressed
Pfuel's
thoughts
in
a
more
comprehensible
way
than
Pfuel
himself
(who
was
a
harsh,
bookish
theorist,
self-confident
to
the
point
of
despising
everyone
else)
was
able
to
do.
Besides
these
Russians
and
foreigners
who
propounded
new
and
unexpected
ideas
every
day--especially
the
foreigners,
who
did
so
with
a
boldness
characteristic
of
people
employed
in
a
country
not
their
own--there
were
many
secondary
personages
accompanying
the
army
because
their
principals
were
there.
Among
the
opinions
and
voices
in
this
immense,
restless,
brilliant,
and
proud
sphere,
Prince
Andrew
noticed
the
following
sharply
defined
subdivisions
of
tendencies
and
parties:
The
first
party
consisted
of
Pfuel
and
his
adherents--military
theorists
who
believed
in
a
science
of
war
with
immutable
laws--laws
of
oblique
movements,
outflankings,
and
so
forth.
Pfuel
and
his
adherents
demanded
a
retirement
into
the
depths
of
the
country
in
accordance
with
precise
laws
defined
by
a
pseudo-theory
of
war,
and
they
saw
only
barbarism,
ignorance,
or
evil
intention
in
every
deviation
from
that
theory.
To
this
party
belonged
the
foreign
nobles,
Wolzogen,
Wintzingerode,
and
others,
chiefly
Germans.
The
second
party
was
directly
opposed
to
the
first;
one
extreme,
as
always
happens,
was
met
by
representatives
of
the
other.
The
members
of
this
party
were
those
who
had
demanded
an
advance
from
Vilna
into
Poland
and
freedom
from
all
prearranged
plans.
Besides
being
advocates
of
bold
action,
this
section
also
represented
nationalism,
which
made
them
still
more
one-sided
in
the
dispute.
They
were
Russians:
Bagration,
Ermolov
(who
was
beginning
to
come
to
the
front),
and
others.
At
that
time
a
famous
joke
of
Ermolov's
was
being
circulated,
that
as
a
great
favor
he
had
petitioned
the
Emperor
to
make
him
a
German.
The
men
of
that
party,
remembering
Suvorov,
said
that
what
one
had
to
do
was
not
to
reason,
or
stick
pins
into
maps,
but
to
fight,
beat
the
enemy,
keep
him
out
of
Russia,
and
not
let
the
army
get
discouraged.
To
the
third
party--in
which
the
Emperor
had
most
confidence--belonged
the
courtiers
who
tried
to
arrange
compromises
between
the
other
two.
The
members
of
this
party,
chiefly
civilians
and
to
whom
Arakcheev
belonged,
thought
and
said
what
men
who
have
no
convictions
but
wish
to
seem
to
have
some
generally
say.
They
said
that
undoubtedly
war,
particularly
against
such
a
genius
as
Bonaparte
(they
called
him
Bonaparte
now),
needs
most
deeply
devised
plans
and
profound
scientific
knowledge
and
in
that
respect
Pfuel
was
a
genius,
but
at
the
same
time
it
had
to
be
acknowledged
that
the
theorists
are
often
one-sided,
and
therefore
one
should
not
trust
them
absolutely,
but
should
also
listen
to
what
Pfuel's
opponents
and
practical
men
of
experience
in
warfare
had
to
say,
and
then
choose
a
middle
course.
They
insisted
on
the
retention
of
the
camp
at
Drissa,
according
to
Pfuel's
plan,
but
on
changing
the
movements
of
the
other
armies.
Though,
by
this
course,
neither
one
aim
nor
the
other
could
be
attained,
yet
it
seemed
best
to
the
adherents
of
this
third
party.
Of
a
fourth
opinion
the
most
conspicuous
representative
was
the
Tsarevich,
who
could
not
forget
his
disillusionment
at
Austerlitz,
where
he
had
ridden
out
at
the
head
of
the
Guards,
in
his
casque
and
cavalry
uniform
as
to
a
review,
expecting
to
crush
the
French
gallantly;
but
unexpectedly
finding
himself
in
the
front
line
had
narrowly
escaped
amid
the
general
confusion.
The
men
of
this
party
had
both
the
quality
and
the
defect
of
frankness
in
their
opinions.
They
feared
Napoleon,
recognized
his
strength
and
their
own
weakness,
and
frankly
said
so.
They
said:
"Nothing
but
sorrow,
shame,
and
ruin
will
come
of
all
this!
We
have
abandoned
Vilna
and
Vitebsk
and
shall
abandon
Drissa.
The
only
reasonable
thing
left
to
do
is
to
conclude
peace
as
soon
as
possible,
before
we
are
turned
out
of
Petersburg."
This
view
was
very
general
in
the
upper
army
circles
and
found
support
also
in
Petersburg
and
from
the
chancellor,
Rumyantsev,
who,
for
other
reasons
of
state,
was
in
favor
of
peace.
The
fifth
party
consisted
of
those
who
were
adherents
of
Barclay
de
Tolly,
not
so
much
as
a
man
but
as
minister
of
war
and
commander-in-
chief.
"Be
he
what
he
may"
(they
always
began
like
that),
"he
is
an
honest,
practical
man
and
we
have
nobody
better.
Give
him
real
power,
for
war
cannot
be
conducted
successfully
without
unity
of
command,
and
he
will
show
what
he
can
do,
as
he
did
in
Finland.
If
our
army
is
well
organized
and
strong
and
has
withdrawn
to
Drissa
without
suffering
any
defeats,
we
owe
this
entirely
to
Barclay.
If
Barclay
is
now
to
be
superseded
by
Bennigsen
all
will
be
lost,
for
Bennigsen
showed
his
incapacity
already
in
1807."
The
sixth
party,
the
Bennigsenites,
said,
on
the
contrary,
that
at
any
rate
there
was
no
one
more
active
and
experienced
than
Bennigsen:
"and
twist
about
as
you
may,
you
will
have
to
come
to
Bennigsen
eventually.
Let
the
others
make
mistakes
now!"
said
they,
arguing
that
our
retirement
to
Drissa
was
a
most
shameful
reverse
and
an
unbroken
series
of
blunders.
"The
more
mistakes
that
are
made
the
better.
It
will
at
any
rate
be
understood
all
the
sooner
that
things
cannot
go
on
like
this.
What
is
wanted
is
not
some
Barclay
or
other,
but
a
man
like
Bennigsen,
who
made
his
mark
in
1807,
and
to
whom
Napoleon
himself
did
justice--a
man
whose
authority
would
be
willingly
recognized,
and
Bennigsen
is
the
only
such
man."
The
seventh
party
consisted
of
the
sort
of
people
who
are
always
to
be
found,
especially
around
young
sovereigns,
and
of
whom
there
were
particularly
many
round
Alexander--generals
and
imperial
aides-de-camp
passionately
devoted
to
the
Emperor,
not
merely
as
a
monarch
but
as
a
man,
adoring
him
sincerely
and
disinterestedly,
as
Rostov
had
done
in
1805,
and
who
saw
in
him
not
only
all
the
virtues
but
all
human
capabilities
as
well.
These
men,
though
enchanted
with
the
sovereign
for
refusing
the
command
of
the
army,
yet
blamed
him
for
such
excessive
modesty,
and
only
desired
and
insisted
that
their
adored
sovereign
should
abandon
his
diffidence
and
openly
announce
that
he
would
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
army,
gather
round
him
a
commander-in-chief's
staff,
and,
consulting
experienced
theoreticians
and
practical
men
where
necessary,
would
himself
lead
the
troops,
whose
spirits
would
thereby
be
raised
to
the
highest
pitch.
The
eighth
and
largest
group,
which
in
its
enormous
numbers
was
to
the
others
as
ninety-nine
to
one,
consisted
of
men
who
desired
neither
peace
nor
war,
neither
an
advance
nor
a
defensive
camp
at
the
Drissa
or
anywhere
else,
neither
Barclay
nor
the
Emperor,
neither
Pfuel
nor
Bennigsen,
but
only
the
one
most
essential
thing--as
much
advantage
and
pleasure
for
themselves
as
possible.
In
the
troubled
waters
of
conflicting
and
intersecting
intrigues
that
eddied
about
the
Emperor's
headquarters,
it
was
possible
to
succeed
in
many
ways
unthinkable
at
other
times.
A
man
who
simply
wished
to
retain
his
lucrative
post
would
today
agree
with
Pfuel,
tomorrow
with
his
opponent,
and
the
day
after,
merely
to
avoid
responsibility
or
to
please
the
Emperor,
would
declare
that
he
had
no
opinion
at
all
on
the
matter.
Another
who
wished
to
gain
some
advantage
would
attract
the
Emperor's
attention
by
loudly
advocating
the
very
thing
the
Emperor
had
hinted
at
the
day
before,
and
would
dispute
and
shout
at
the
council,
beating
his
breast
and
challenging
those
who
did
not
agree
with
him
to
duels,
thereby
proving
that
he
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
himself
for
the
common
good.
A
third,
in
the
absence
of
opponents,
between
two
councils
would
simply
solicit
a
special
gratuity
for
his
faithful
services,
well
knowing
that
at
that
moment
people
would
be
too
busy
to
refuse
him.
A
fourth
while
seemingly
overwhelmed
with
work
would
often
come
accidentally
under
the
Emperor's
eye.
A
fifth,
to
achieve
his
long-cherished
aim
of
dining
with
the
Emperor,
would
stubbornly
insist
on
the
correctness
or
falsity
of
some
newly
emerging
opinion
and
for
this
object
would
produce
arguments
more
or
less
forcible
and
correct.
All
the
men
of
this
party
were
fishing
for
rubles,
decorations,
and
promotions,
and
in
this
pursuit
watched
only
the
weathercock
of
imperial
favor,
and
directly
they
noticed
it
turning
in
any
direction,
this
whole
drone
population
of
the
army
began
blowing
hard
that
way,
so
that
it
was
all
the
harder
for
the
Emperor
to
turn
it
elsewhere.
Amid
the
uncertainties
of
the
position,
with
the
menace
of
serious
danger
giving
a
peculiarly
threatening
character
to
everything,
amid
this
vortex
of
intrigue,
egotism,
conflict
of
views
and
feelings,
and
the
diversity
of
race
among
these
people--this
eighth
and
largest
party
of
those
preoccupied
with
personal
interests
imparted
great
confusion
and
obscurity
to
the
common
task.
Whatever
question
arose,
a
swarm
of
these
drones,
without
having
finished
their
buzzing
on
a
previous
theme,
flew
over
to
the
new
one
and
by
their
hum
drowned
and
obscured
the
voices
of
those
who
were
disputing
honestly.
From
among
all
these
parties,
just
at
the
time
Prince
Andrew
reached
the
army,
another,
a
ninth
party,
was
being
formed
and
was
beginning
to
raise
its
voice.
This
was
the
party
of
the
elders,
reasonable
men
experienced
and
capable
in
state
affairs,
who,
without
sharing
any
of
those
conflicting
opinions,
were
able
to
take
a
detached
view
of
what
was
going
on
at
the
staff
at
headquarters
and
to
consider
means
of
escape
from
this
muddle,
indecision,
intricacy,
and
weakness.
The
men
of
this
party
said
and
thought
that
what
was
wrong
resulted
chiefly
from
the
Emperor's
presence
in
the
army
with
his
military
court
and
from
the
consequent
presence
there
of
an
indefinite,
conditional,
and
unsteady
fluctuation
of
relations,
which
is
in
place
at
court
but
harmful
in
an
army;
that
a
sovereign
should
reign
but
not
command
the
army,
and
that
the
only
way
out
of
the
position
would
be
for
the
Emperor
and
his
court
to
leave
the
army;
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
Emperor
paralyzed
the
action
of
fifty
thousand
men
required
to
secure
his
personal
safety,
and
that
the
worst
commander-in-chief,
if
independent,
would
be
better
than
the
very
best
one
trammeled
by
the
presence
and
authority
of
the
monarch.
Just
at
the
time
Prince
Andrew
was
living
unoccupied
at
Drissa,
Shishkov,
the
Secretary
of
State
and
one
of
the
chief
representatives
of
this
party,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Emperor
which
Arakcheev
and
Balashev
agreed
to
sign.
In
this
letter,
availing
himself
of
permission
given
him
by
the
Emperor
to
discuss
the
general
course
of
affairs,
he
respectfully
suggested--on
the
plea
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
sovereign
to
arouse
a
warlike
spirit
in
the
people
of
the
capital--that
the
Emperor
should
leave
the
army.
That
arousing
of
the
people
by
their
sovereign
and
his
call
to
them
to
defend
their
country--the
very
incitement
which
was
the
chief
cause
of
Russia's
triumph
in
so
far
as
it
was
produced
by
the
Tsar's
personal
presence
in
Moscow--was
suggested
to
the
Emperor,
and
accepted
by
him,
as
a
pretext
for
quitting
the
army.
CHAPTER
X
This
letter
had
not
yet
been
presented
to
the
Emperor
when
Barclay,
one
day
at
dinner,
informed
Bolkonski
that
the
sovereign
wished
to
see
him
personally,
to
question
him
about
Turkey,
and
that
Prince
Andrew
was
to
present
himself
at
Bennigsen's
quarters
at
six
that
evening.
News
was
received
at
the
Emperor's
quarters
that
very
day
of
a
fresh
movement
by
Napoleon
which
might
endanger
the
army--news
subsequently
found
to
be
false.
And
that
morning
Colonel
Michaud
had
ridden
round
the
Drissa
fortifications
with
the
Emperor
and
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
this
fortified
camp
constructed
by
Pfuel,
and
till
then
considered
a
chef-d'oeuvre
of
tactical
science
which
would
ensure
Napoleon's
destruction,
was
an
absurdity,
threatening
the
destruction
of
the
Russian
army.
Prince
Andrew
arrived
at
Bennigsen's
quarters--a
country
gentleman's
house
of
moderate
size,
situated
on
the
very
banks
of
the
river.
Neither
Bennigsen
nor
the
Emperor
was
there,
but
Chernyshev,
the
Emperor's
aide-
de-camp,
received
Bolkonski
and
informed
him
that
the
Emperor,
accompanied
by
General
Bennigsen
and
Marquis
Paulucci,
had
gone
a
second
time
that
day
to
inspect
the
fortifications
of
the
Drissa
camp,
of
the
suitability
of
which
serious
doubts
were
beginning
to
be
felt.
Chernyshev
was
sitting
at
a
window
in
the
first
room
with
a
French
novel
in
his
hand.
This
room
had
probably
been
a
music
room;
there
was
still
an
organ
in
it
on
which
some
rugs
were
piled,
and
in
one
corner
stood
the
folding
bedstead
of
Bennigsen's
adjutant.
This
adjutant
was
also
there
and
sat
dozing
on
the
rolled-up
bedding,
evidently
exhausted
by
work
or
by
feasting.
Two
doors
led
from
the
room,
one
straight
on
into
what
had
been
the
drawing
room,
and
another,
on
the
right,
to
the
study.
Through
the
first
door
came
the
sound
of
voices
conversing
in
German
and
occasionally
in
French.
In
that
drawing
room
were
gathered,
by
the
Emperor's
wish,
not
a
military
council
(the
Emperor
preferred
indefiniteness),
but
certain
persons
whose
opinions
he
wished
to
know
in
view
of
the
impending
difficulties.
It
was
not
a
council
of
war,
but,
as
it
were,
a
council
to
elucidate
certain
questions
for
the
Emperor
personally.
To
this
semicouncil
had
been
invited
the
Swedish
General
Armfeldt,
Adjutant
General
Wolzogen,
Wintzingerode
(whom
Napoleon
had
referred
to
as
a
renegade
French
subject),
Michaud,
Toll,
Count
Stein
who
was
not
a
military
man
at
all,
and
Pfuel
himself,
who,
as
Prince
Andrew
had
heard,
was
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
affair.
Prince
Andrew
had
an
opportunity
of
getting
a
good
look
at
him,
for
Pfuel
arrived
soon
after
himself
and,
in
passing
through
to
the
drawing
room,
stopped
a
minute
to
speak
to
Chernyshev.
At
first
sight,
Pfuel,
in
his
ill-made
uniform
of
a
Russian
general,
which
fitted
him
badly
like
a
fancy
costume,
seemed
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew,
though
he
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time.
There
was
about
him
something
of
Weyrother,
Mack,
and
Schmidt,
and
many
other
German
theorist-generals
whom
Prince
Andrew
had
seen
in
1805,
but
he
was
more
typical
than
any
of
them.
Prince
Andrew
had
never
yet
seen
a
German
theorist
in
whom
all
the
characteristics
of
those
others
were
united
to
such
an
extent.
Pfuel
was
short
and
very
thin
but
broad-boned,
of
coarse,
robust
build,
broad
in
the
hips,
and
with
prominent
shoulder
blades.
His
face
was
much
wrinkled
and
his
eyes
deep
set.
His
hair
had
evidently
been
hastily
brushed
smooth
in
front
of
the
temples,
but
stuck
up
behind
in
quaint
little
tufts.
He
entered
the
room,
looking
restlessly
and
angrily
around,
as
if
afraid
of
everything
in
that
large
apartment.
Awkwardly
holding
up
his
sword,
he
addressed
Chernyshev
and
asked
in
German
where
the
Emperor
was.
One
could
see
that
he
wished
to
pass
through
the
rooms
as
quickly
as
possible,
finish
with
the
bows
and
greetings,
and
sit
down
to
business
in
front
of
a
map,
where
he
would
feel
at
home.
He
nodded
hurriedly
in
reply
to
Chernyshev,
and
smiled
ironically
on
hearing
that
the
sovereign
was
inspecting
the
fortifications
that
he,
Pfuel,
had
planned
in
accord
with
his
theory.
He
muttered
something
to
himself
abruptly
and
in
a
bass
voice,
as
self-assured
Germans
do--it
might
have
been
"stupid
fellow"...
or
"the
whole
affair
will
be
ruined,"
or
"something
absurd
will
come
of
it."...
Prince
Andrew
did
not
catch
what
he
said
and
would
have
passed
on,
but
Chernyshev
introduced
him
to
Pfuel,
remarking
that
Prince
Andrew
was
just
back
from
Turkey
where
the
war
had
terminated
so
fortunately.
Pfuel
barely
glanced--not
so
much
at
Prince
Andrew
as
past
him--and
said,
with
a
laugh:
"That
must
have
been
a
fine
tactical
war";
and,
laughing
contemptuously,
went
on
into
the
room
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
was
heard.
Pfuel,
always
inclined
to
be
irritably
sarcastic,
was
particularly
disturbed
that
day,
evidently
by
the
fact
that
they
had
dared
to
inspect
and
criticize
his
camp
in
his
absence.
From
this
short
interview
with
Pfuel,
Prince
Andrew,
thanks
to
his
Austerlitz
experiences,
was
able
to
form
a
clear
conception
of
the
man.
Pfuel
was
one
of
those
hopelessly
and
immutably
self-confident
men,
self-confident
to
the
point
of
martyrdom
as
only
Germans
are,
because
only
Germans
are
self-confident
on
the
basis
of
an
abstract
notion--science,
that
is,
the
supposed
knowledge
of
absolute
truth.
A
Frenchman
is
self-assured
because
he
regards
himself
personally,
both
in
mind
and
body,
as
irresistibly
attractive
to
men
and
women.
An
Englishman
is
self-assured,
as
being
a
citizen
of
the
best-organized
state
in
the
world,
and
therefore
as
an
Englishman
always
knows
what
he
should
do
and
knows
that
all
he
does
as
an
Englishman
is
undoubtedly
correct.
An
Italian
is
self-assured
because
he
is
excitable
and
easily
forgets
himself
and
other
people.
A
Russian
is
self-assured
just
because
he
knows
nothing
and
does
not
want
to
know
anything,
since
he
does
not
believe
that
anything
can
be
known.
The
German's
self-assurance
is
worst
of
all,
stronger
and
more
repulsive
than
any
other,
because
he
imagines
that
he
knows
the
truth--science--
which
he
himself
has
invented
but
which
is
for
him
the
absolute
truth.
Pfuel
was
evidently
of
that
sort.
He
had
a
science--the
theory
of
oblique
movements
deduced
by
him
from
the
history
of
Frederick
the
Great's
wars,
and
all
he
came
across
in
the
history
of
more
recent
warfare
seemed
to
him
absurd
and
barbarous--monstrous
collisions
in
which
so
many
blunders
were
committed
by
both
sides
that
these
wars
could
not
be
called
wars,
they
did
not
accord
with
the
theory,
and
therefore
could
not
serve
as
material
for
science.
In
1806
Pfuel
had
been
one
of
those
responsible,
for
the
plan
of
campaign
that
ended
in
Jena
and
Auerstadt,
but
he
did
not
see
the
least
proof
of
the
fallibility
of
his
theory
in
the
disasters
of
that
war.
On
the
contrary,
the
deviations
made
from
his
theory
were,
in
his
opinion,
the
sole
cause
of
the
whole
disaster,
and
with
characteristically
gleeful
sarcasm
he
would
remark,
"There,
I
said
the
whole
affair
would
go
to
the
devil!"
Pfuel
was
one
of
those
theoreticians
who
so
love
their
theory
that
they
lose
sight
of
the
theory's
object--its
practical
application.
His
love
of
theory
made
him
hate
everything
practical,
and
he
would
not
listen
to
it.
He
was
even
pleased
by
failures,
for
failures
resulting
from
deviations
in
practice
from
the
theory
only
proved
to
him
the
accuracy
of
his
theory.
He
said
a
few
words
to
Prince
Andrew
and
Chernyshev
about
the
present
war,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
knows
beforehand
that
all
will
go
wrong,
and
who
is
not
displeased
that
it
should
be
so.
The
unbrushed
tufts
of
hair
sticking
up
behind
and
the
hastily
brushed
hair
on
his
temples
expressed
this
most
eloquently.
He
passed
into
the
next
room,
and
the
deep,
querulous
sounds
of
his
voice
were
at
once
heard
from
there.
CHAPTER
XI
Prince
Andrew's
eyes
were
still
following
Pfuel
out
of
the
room
when
Count
Bennigsen
entered
hurriedly,
and
nodding
to
Bolkonski,
but
not
pausing,
went
into
the
study,
giving
instructions
to
his
adjutant
as
he
went.
The
Emperor
was
following
him,
and
Bennigsen
had
hastened
on
to
make
some
preparations
and
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
sovereign.
Chernyshev
and
Prince
Andrew
went
out
into
the
porch,
where
the
Emperor,
who
looked
fatigued,
was
dismounting.
Marquis
Paulucci
was
talking
to
him
with
particular
warmth
and
the
Emperor,
with
his
head
bent
to
the
left,
was
listening
with
a
dissatisfied
air.
The
Emperor
moved
forward
evidently
wishing
to
end
the
conversation,
but
the
flushed
and
excited
Italian,
oblivious
of
decorum,
followed
him
and
continued
to
speak.
"And
as
for
the
man
who
advised
forming
this
camp--the
Drissa
camp,"
said
Paulucci,
as
the
Emperor
mounted
the
steps
and
noticing
Prince
Andrew
scanned
his
unfamiliar
face,
"as
to
that
person,
sire..."
continued
Paulucci,
desperately,
apparently
unable
to
restrain
himself,
"the
man
who
advised
the
Drissa
camp--I
see
no
alternative
but
the
lunatic
asylum
or
the
gallows!"
Without
heeding
the
end
of
the
Italian's
remarks,
and
as
though
not
hearing
them,
the
Emperor,
recognizing
Bolkonski,
addressed
him
graciously.
"I
am
very
glad
to
see
you!
Go
in
there
where
they
are
meeting,
and
wait
for
me."
The
Emperor
went
into
the
study.
He
was
followed
by
Prince
Peter
Mikhaylovich
Volkonski
and
Baron
Stein,
and
the
door
closed
behind
them.
Prince
Andrew,
taking
advantage
of
the
Emperor's
permission,
accompanied
Paulucci,
whom
he
had
known
in
Turkey,
into
the
drawing
room
where
the
council
was
assembled.
Prince
Peter
Mikhaylovich
Volkonski
occupied
the
position,
as
it
were,
of
chief
of
the
Emperor's
staff.
He
came
out
of
the
study
into
the
drawing
room
with
some
maps
which
he
spread
on
a
table,
and
put
questions
on
which
he
wished
to
hear
the
opinion
of
the
gentlemen
present.
What
had
happened
was
that
news
(which
afterwards
proved
to
be
false)
had
been
received
during
the
night
of
a
movement
by
the
French
to
outflank
the
Drissa
camp.
The
first
to
speak
was
General
Armfeldt
who,
to
meet
the
difficulty
that
presented
itself,
unexpectedly
proposed
a
perfectly
new
position
away
from
the
Petersburg
and
Moscow
roads.
The
reason
for
this
was
inexplicable
(unless
he
wished
to
show
that
he,
too,
could
have
an
opinion),
but
he
urged
that
at
this
point
the
army
should
unite
and
there
await
the
enemy.
It
was
plain
that
Armfeldt
had
thought
out
that
plan
long
ago
and
now
expounded
it
not
so
much
to
answer
the
questions
put--which,
in
fact,
his
plan
did
not
answer--as
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
to
air
it.
It
was
one
of
the
millions
of
proposals,
one
as
good
as
another,
that
could
be
made
as
long
as
it
was
quite
unknown
what
character
the
war
would
take.
Some
disputed
his
arguments,
others
defended
them.
Young
Count
Toll
objected
to
the
Swedish
general's
views
more
warmly
than
anyone
else,
and
in
the
course
of
the
dispute
drew
from
his
side
pocket
a
well-filled
notebook,
which
he
asked
permission
to
read
to
them.
In
these
voluminous
notes
Toll
suggested
another
scheme,
totally
different
from
Armfeldt's
or
Pfuel's
plan
of
campaign.
In
answer
to
Toll,
Paulucci
suggested
an
advance
and
an
attack,
which,
he
urged,
could
alone
extricate
us
from
the
present
uncertainty
and
from
the
trap
(as
he
called
the
Drissa
camp)
in
which
we
were
situated.
During
all
these
discussions
Pfuel
and
his
interpreter,
Wolzogen
(his
"bridge"
in
court
relations),
were
silent.
Pfuel
only
snorted
contemptuously
and
turned
away,
to
show
that
he
would
never
demean
himself
by
replying
to
such
nonsense
as
he
was
now
hearing.
So
when
Prince
Volkonski,
who
was
in
the
chair,
called
on
him
to
give
his
opinion,
he
merely
said:
"Why
ask
me?
General
Armfeldt
has
proposed
a
splendid
position
with
an
exposed
rear,
or
why
not
this
Italian
gentleman's
attack--very
fine,
or
a
retreat,
also
good!
Why
ask
me?"
said
he.
"Why,
you
yourselves
know
everything
better
than
I
do."
But
when
Volkonski
said,
with
a
frown,
that
it
was
in
the
Emperor's
name
that
he
asked
his
opinion,
Pfuel
rose
and,
suddenly
growing
animated,
began
to
speak:
"Everything
has
been
spoiled,
everything
muddled,
everybody
thought
they
knew
better
than
I
did,
and
now
you
come
to
me!
How
mend
matters?
There
is
nothing
to
mend!
The
principles
laid
down
by
me
must
be
strictly
adhered
to,"
said
he,
drumming
on
the
table
with
his
bony
fingers.
"What
is
the
difficulty?
Nonsense,
childishness!"
He
went
up
to
the
map
and
speaking
rapidly
began
proving
that
no
eventuality
could
alter
the
efficiency
of
the
Drissa
camp,
that
everything
had
been
foreseen,
and
that
if
the
enemy
were
really
going
to
outflank
it,
the
enemy
would
inevitably
be
destroyed.
Paulucci,
who
did
not
know
German,
began
questioning
him
in
French.
Wolzogen
came
to
the
assistance
of
his
chief,
who
spoke
French
badly,
and
began
translating
for
him,
hardly
able
to
keep
pace
with
Pfuel,
who
was
rapidly
demonstrating
that
not
only
all
that
had
happened,
but
all
that
could
happen,
had
been
foreseen
in
his
scheme,
and
that
if
there
were
now
any
difficulties
the
whole
fault
lay
in
the
fact
that
his
plan
had
not
been
precisely
executed.
He
kept
laughing
sarcastically,
he
demonstrated,
and
at
last
contemptuously
ceased
to
demonstrate,
like
a
mathematician
who
ceases
to
prove
in
various
ways
the
accuracy
of
a
problem
that
has
already
been
proved.
Wolzogen
took
his
place
and
continued
to
explain
his
views
in
French,
every
now
and
then
turning
to
Pfuel
and
saying,
"Is
it
not
so,
your
excellency?"
But
Pfuel,
like
a
man
heated
in
a
fight
who
strikes
those
on
his
own
side,
shouted
angrily
at
his
own
supporter,
Wolzogen:
"Well,
of
course,
what
more
is
there
to
explain?"
Paulucci
and
Michaud
both
attacked
Wolzogen
simultaneously
in
French.
Armfeldt
addressed
Pfuel
in
German.
Toll
explained
to
Volkonski
in
Russian.
Prince
Andrew
listened
and
observed
in
silence.
Of
all
these
men
Prince
Andrew
sympathized
most
with
Pfuel,
angry,
determined,
and
absurdly
self-confident
as
he
was.
Of
all
those
present,
evidently
he
alone
was
not
seeking
anything
for
himself,
nursed
no
hatred
against
anyone,
and
only
desired
that
the
plan,
formed
on
a
theory
arrived
at
by
years
of
toil,
should
be
carried
out.
He
was
ridiculous,
and
unpleasantly
sarcastic,
but
yet
he
inspired
involuntary
respect
by
his
boundless
devotion
to
an
idea.
Besides
this,
the
remarks
of
all
except
Pfuel
had
one
common
trait
that
had
not
been
noticeable
at
the
council
of
war
in
1805:
there
was
now
a
panic
fear
of
Napoleon's
genius,
which,
though
concealed,
was
noticeable
in
every
rejoinder.
Everything
was
assumed
to
be
possible
for
Napoleon,
they
expected
him
from
every
side,
and
invoked
his
terrible
name
to
shatter
each
other's
proposals.
Pfuel
alone
seemed
to
consider
Napoleon
a
barbarian
like
everyone
else
who
opposed
his
theory.
But
besides
this
feeling
of
respect,
Pfuel
evoked
pity
in
Prince
Andrew.
From
the
tone
in
which
the
courtiers
addressed
him
and
the
way
Paulucci
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
of
him
to
the
Emperor,
but
above
all
from
a
certain
desperation
in
Pfuel's
own
expressions,
it
was
clear
that
the
others
knew,
and
Pfuel
himself
felt,
that
his
fall
was
at
hand.
And
despite
his
self-confidence
and
grumpy
German
sarcasm
he
was
pitiable,
with
his
hair
smoothly
brushed
on
the
temples
and
sticking
up
in
tufts
behind.
Though
he
concealed
the
fact
under
a
show
of
irritation
and
contempt,
he
was
evidently
in
despair
that
the
sole
remaining
chance
of
verifying
his
theory
by
a
huge
experiment
and
proving
its
soundness
to
the
whole
world
was
slipping
away
from
him.
The
discussions
continued
a
long
time,
and
the
longer
they
lasted
the
more
heated
became
the
disputes,
culminating
in
shouts
and
personalities,
and
the
less
was
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
general
conclusion
from
all
that
had
been
said.
Prince
Andrew,
listening
to
this
polyglot
talk
and
to
these
surmises,
plans,
refutations,
and
shouts,
felt
nothing
but
amazement
at
what
they
were
saying.
A
thought
that
had
long
since
and
often
occurred
to
him
during
his
military
activities--the
idea
that
there
is
not
and
cannot
be
any
science
of
war,
and
that
therefore
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
military
genius--now
appeared
to
him
an
obvious
truth.
"What
theory
and
science
is
possible
about
a
matter
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
which
are
unknown
and
cannot
be
defined,
especially
when
the
strength
of
the
acting
forces
cannot
be
ascertained?
No
one
was
or
is
able
to
foresee
in
what
condition
our
or
the
enemy's
armies
will
be
in
a
day's
time,
and
no
one
can
gauge
the
force
of
this
or
that
detachment.
Sometimes--when
there
is
not
a
coward
at
the
front
to
shout,
'We
are
cut
off!'
and
start
running,
but
a
brave
and
jolly
lad
who
shouts,
'Hurrah!'--a
detachment
of
five
thousand
is
worth
thirty
thousand,
as
at
Schon
Grabern,
while
at
times
fifty
thousand
run
from
eight
thousand,
as
at
Austerlitz.
What
science
can
there
be
in
a
matter
in
which,
as
in
all
practical
matters,
nothing
can
be
defined
and
everything
depends
on
innumerable
conditions,
the
significance
of
which
is
determined
at
a
particular
moment
which
arrives
no
one
knows
when?
Armfeldt
says
our
army
is
cut
in
half,
and
Paulucci
says
we
have
got
the
French
army
between
two
fires;
Michaud
says
that
the
worthlessness
of
the
Drissa
camp
lies
in
having
the
river
behind
it,
and
Pfuel
says
that
is
what
constitutes
its
strength;
Toll
proposes
one
plan,
Armfeldt
another,
and
they
are
all
good
and
all
bad,
and
the
advantages
of
any
suggestions
can
be
seen
only
at
the
moment
of
trial.
And
why
do
they
all
speak
of
a
'military
genius'?
Is
a
man
a
genius
who
can
order
bread
to
be
brought
up
at
the
right
time
and
say
who
is
to
go
to
the
right
and
who
to
the
left?
It
is
only
because
military
men
are
invested
with
pomp
and
power
and
crowds
of
sychophants
flatter
power,
attributing
to
it
qualities
of
genius
it
does
not
possess.
The
best
generals
I
have
known
were,
on
the
contrary,
stupid
or
absent-minded
men.
Bagration
was
the
best,
Napoleon
himself
admitted
that.
And
of
Bonaparte
himself!
I
remember
his
limited,
self-satisfied
face
on
the
field
of
Austerlitz.
Not
only
does
a
good
army
commander
not
need
any
special
qualities,
on
the
contrary
he
needs
the
absence
of
the
highest
and
best
human
attributes--love,
poetry,
tenderness,
and
philosophic
inquiring
doubt.
He
should
be
limited,
firmly
convinced
that
what
he
is
doing
is
very
important
(otherwise
he
will
not
have
sufficient
patience),
and
only
then
will
he
be
a
brave
leader.
God
forbid
that
he
should
be
humane,
should
love,
or
pity,
or
think
of
what
is
just
and
unjust.
It
is
understandable
that
a
theory
of
their
'genius'
was
invented
for
them
long
ago
because
they
have
power!
The
success
of
a
military
action
depends
not
on
them,
but
on
the
man
in
the
ranks
who
shouts,
'We
are
lost!'
or
who
shouts,
'Hurrah!'
And
only
in
the
ranks
can
one
serve
with
assurance
of
being
useful."
So
thought
Prince
Andrew
as
he
listened
to
the
talking,
and
he
roused
himself
only
when
Paulucci
called
him
and
everyone
was
leaving.
At
the
review
next
day
the
Emperor
asked
Prince
Andrew
where
he
would
like
to
serve,
and
Prince
Andrew
lost
his
standing
in
court
circles
forever
by
not
asking
to
remain
attached
to
the
sovereign's
person,
but
for
permission
to
serve
in
the
army.
CHAPTER
XII
Before
the
beginning
of
the
campaign,
Rostov
had
received
a
letter
from
his
parents
in
which
they
told
him
briefly
of
Natasha's
illness
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement
to
Prince
Andrew
(which
they
explained
by
Natasha's
having
rejected
him)
and
again
asked
Nicholas
to
retire
from
the
army
and
return
home.
On
receiving
this
letter,
Nicholas
did
not
even
make
any
attempt
to
get
leave
of
absence
or
to
retire
from
the
army,
but
wrote
to
his
parents
that
he
was
sorry
Natasha
was
ill
and
her
engagement
broken
off,
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
to
meet
their
wishes.
To
Sonya
he
wrote
separately.
"Adored
friend
of
my
soul!"
he
wrote.
"Nothing
but
honor
could
keep
me
from
returning
to
the
country.
But
now,
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign,
I
should
feel
dishonored,
not
only
in
my
comrades'
eyes
but
in
my
own,
if
I
preferred
my
own
happiness
to
my
love
and
duty
to
the
Fatherland.
But
this
shall
be
our
last
separation.
Believe
me,
directly
the
war
is
over,
if
I
am
still
alive
and
still
loved
by
you,
I
will
throw
up
everything
and
fly
to
you,
to
press
you
forever
to
my
ardent
breast."
It
was,
in
fact,
only
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
that
prevented
Rostov
from
returning
home
as
he
had
promised
and
marrying
Sonya.
The
autumn
in
Otradnoe
with
the
hunting,
and
the
winter
with
the
Christmas
holidays
and
Sonya's
love,
had
opened
out
to
him
a
vista
of
tranquil
rural
joys
and
peace
such
as
he
had
never
known
before,
and
which
now
allured
him.
"A
splendid
wife,
children,
a
good
pack
of
hounds,
a
dozen
leashes
of
smart
borzois,
agriculture,
neighbors,
service
by
election..."
thought
he.
But
now
the
campaign
was
beginning,
and
he
had
to
remain
with
his
regiment.
And
since
it
had
to
be
so,
Nicholas
Rostov,
as
was
natural
to
him,
felt
contented
with
the
life
he
led
in
the
regiment
and
was
able
to
find
pleasure
in
that
life.
On
his
return
from
his
furlough
Nicholas,
having
been
joyfully
welcomed
by
his
comrades,
was
sent
to
obtain
remounts
and
brought
back
from
the
Ukraine
excellent
horses
which
pleased
him
and
earned
him
commendation
from
his
commanders.
During
his
absence
he
had
been
promoted
captain,
and
when
the
regiment
was
put
on
war
footing
with
an
increase
in
numbers,
he
was
again
allotted
his
old
squadron.
The
campaign
began,
the
regiment
was
moved
into
Poland
on
double
pay,
new
officers
arrived,
new
men
and
horses,
and
above
all
everybody
was
infected
with
the
merrily
excited
mood
that
goes
with
the
commencement
of
a
war,
and
Rostov,
conscious
of
his
advantageous
position
in
the
regiment,
devoted
himself
entirely
to
the
pleasures
and
interests
of
military
service,
though
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
relinquish
them.
The
troops
retired
from
Vilna
for
various
complicated
reasons
of
state,
political
and
strategic.
Each
step
of
the
retreat
was
accompanied
by
a
complicated
interplay
of
interests,
arguments,
and
passions
at
headquarters.
For
the
Pavlograd
hussars,
however,
the
whole
of
this
retreat
during
the
finest
period
of
summer
and
with
sufficient
supplies
was
a
very
simple
and
agreeable
business.
It
was
only
at
headquarters
that
there
was
depression,
uneasiness,
and
intriguing;
in
the
body
of
the
army
they
did
not
ask
themselves
where
they
were
going
or
why.
If
they
regretted
having
to
retreat,
it
was
only
because
they
had
to
leave
billets
they
had
grown
accustomed
to,
or
some
pretty
young
Polish
lady.
If
the
thought
that
things
looked
bad
chanced
to
enter
anyone's
head,
he
tried
to
be
as
cheerful
as
befits
a
good
soldier
and
not
to
think
of
the
general
trend
of
affairs,
but
only
of
the
task
nearest
to
hand.
First
they
camped
gaily
before
Vilna,
making
acquaintance
with
the
Polish
landowners,
preparing
for
reviews
and
being
reviewed
by
the
Emperor
and
other
high
commanders.
Then
came
an
order
to
retreat
to
Sventsyani
and
destroy
any
provisions
they
could
not
carry
away
with
them.
Sventsyani
was
remembered
by
the
hussars
only
as
the
drunken
camp,
a
name
the
whole
army
gave
to
their
encampment
there,
and
because
many
complaints
were
made
against
the
troops,
who,
taking
advantage
of
the
order
to
collect
provisions,
took
also
horses,
carriages,
and
carpets
from
the
Polish
proprietors.
Rostov
remembered
Sventsyani,
because
on
the
first
day
of
their
arrival
at
that
small
town
he
changed
his
sergeant
major
and
was
unable
to
manage
all
the
drunken
men
of
his
squadron
who,
unknown
to
him,
had
appropriated
five
barrels
of
old
beer.
From
Sventsyani
they
retired
farther
and
farther
to
Drissa,
and
thence
again
beyond
Drissa,
drawing
near
to
the
frontier
of
Russia
proper.
On
the
thirteenth
of
July
the
Pavlograds
took
part
in
a
serious
action
for
the
first
time.
On
the
twelfth
of
July,
on
the
eve
of
that
action,
there
was
a
heavy
storm
of
rain
and
hail.
In
general,
the
summer
of
1812
was
remarkable
for
its
storms.
The
two
Pavlograd
squadrons
were
bivouacking
on
a
field
of
rye,
which
was
already
in
ear
but
had
been
completely
trodden
down
by
cattle
and
horses.
The
rain
was
descending
in
torrents,
and
Rostov,
with
a
young
officer
named
Ilyin,
his
protege,
was
sitting
in
a
hastily
constructed
shelter.
An
officer
of
their
regiment,
with
long
mustaches
extending
onto
his
cheeks,
who
after
riding
to
the
staff
had
been
overtaken
by
the
rain,
entered
Rostov's
shelter.
"I
have
come
from
the
staff,
Count.
Have
you
heard
of
Raevski's
exploit?"
And
the
officer
gave
them
details
of
the
Saltanov
battle,
which
he
had
heard
at
the
staff.
Rostov,
smoking
his
pipe
and
turning
his
head
about
as
the
water
trickled
down
his
neck,
listened
inattentively,
with
an
occasional
glance
at
Ilyin,
who
was
pressing
close
to
him.
This
officer,
a
lad
of
sixteen
who
had
recently
joined
the
regiment,
was
now
in
the
same
relation
to
Nicholas
that
Nicholas
had
been
to
Denisov
seven
years
before.
Ilyin
tried
to
imitate
Rostov
in
everything
and
adored
him
as
a
girl
might
have
done.
Zdrzhinski,
the
officer
with
the
long
mustache,
spoke
grandiloquently
of
the
Saltanov
dam
being
"a
Russian
Thermopylae,"
and
of
how
a
deed
worthy
of
antiquity
had
been
performed
by
General
Raevski.
He
recounted
how
Raevski
had
led
his
two
sons
onto
the
dam
under
terrific
fire
and
had
charged
with
them
beside
him.
Rostov
heard
the
story
and
not
only
said
nothing
to
encourage
Zdrzhinski's
enthusiasm
but,
on
the
contrary,
looked
like
a
man
ashamed
of
what
he
was
hearing,
though
with
no
intention
of
contradicting
it.
Since
the
campaigns
of
Austerlitz
and
of
1807
Rostov
knew
by
experience
that
men
always
lie
when
describing
military
exploits,
as
he
himself
had
done
when
recounting
them;
besides
that,
he
had
experience
enough
to
know
that
nothing
happens
in
war
at
all
as
we
can
imagine
or
relate
it.
And
so
he
did
not
like
Zdrzhinski's
tale,
nor
did
he
like
Zdrzhinski
himself
who,
with
his
mustaches
extending
over
his
cheeks,
bent
low
over
the
face
of
his
hearer,
as
was
his
habit,
and
crowded
Rostov
in
the
narrow
shanty.
Rostov
looked
at
him
in
silence.
"In
the
first
place,
there
must
have
been
such
a
confusion
and
crowding
on
the
dam
that
was
being
attacked
that
if
Raevski
did
lead
his
sons
there,
it
could
have
had
no
effect
except
perhaps
on
some
dozen
men
nearest
to
him,"
thought
he,
"the
rest
could
not
have
seen
how
or
with
whom
Raevski
came
onto
the
dam.
And
even
those
who
did
see
it
would
not
have
been
much
stimulated
by
it,
for
what
had
they
to
do
with
Raevski's
tender
paternal
feelings
when
their
own
skins
were
in
danger?
And
besides,
the
fate
of
the
Fatherland
did
not
depend
on
whether
they
took
the
Saltanov
dam
or
not,
as
we
are
told
was
the
case
at
Thermopylae.
So
why
should
he
have
made
such
a
sacrifice?
And
why
expose
his
own
children
in
the
battle?
I
would
not
have
taken
my
brother
Petya
there,
or
even
Ilyin,
who's
a
stranger
to
me
but
a
nice
lad,
but
would
have
tried
to
put
them
somewhere
under
cover,"
Nicholas
continued
to
think,
as
he
listened
to
Zdrzhinski.
But
he
did
not
express
his
thoughts,
for
in
such
matters,
too,
he
had
gained
experience.
He
knew
that
this
tale
redounded
to
the
glory
of
our
arms
and
so
one
had
to
pretend
not
to
doubt
it.
And
he
acted
accordingly.
"I
can't
stand
this
any
more,"
said
Ilyin,
noticing
that
Rostov
did
not
relish
Zdrzhinski's
conversation.
"My
stockings
and
shirt...
and
the
water
is
running
on
my
seat!
I'll
go
and
look
for
shelter.
The
rain
seems
less
heavy."
Ilyin
went
out
and
Zdrzhinski
rode
away.
Five
minutes
later
Ilyin,
splashing
through
the
mud,
came
running
back
to
the
shanty.
"Hurrah!
Rostov,
come
quick!
I've
found
it!
About
two
hundred
yards
away
there's
a
tavern
where
ours
have
already
gathered.
We
can
at
least
get
dry
there,
and
Mary
Hendrikhovna's
there."
Mary
Hendrikhovna
was
the
wife
of
the
regimental
doctor,
a
pretty
young
German
woman
he
had
married
in
Poland.
The
doctor,
whether
from
lack
of
means
or
because
he
did
not
like
to
part
from
his
young
wife
in
the
early
days
of
their
marriage,
took
her
about
with
him
wherever
the
hussar
regiment
went
and
his
jealousy
had
become
a
standing
joke
among
the
hussar
officers.
Rostov
threw
his
cloak
over
his
shoulders,
shouted
to
Lavrushka
to
follow
with
the
things,
and--now
slipping
in
the
mud,
now
splashing
right
through
it--set
off
with
Ilyin
in
the
lessening
rain
and
the
darkness
that
was
occasionally
rent
by
distant
lightning.
"Rostov,
where
are
you?"
"Here.
What
lightning!"
they
called
to
one
another.
CHAPTER
XIII
In
the
tavern,
before
which
stood
the
doctor's
covered
cart,
there
were
already
some
five
officers.
Mary
Hendrikhovna,
a
plump
little
blonde
German,
in
a
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap,
was
sitting
on
a
broad
bench
in
the
front
corner.
Her
husband,
the
doctor,
lay
asleep
behind
her.
Rostov
and
Ilyin,
on
entering
the
room,
were
welcomed
with
merry
shouts
and
laughter.
"Dear
me,
how
jolly
we
are!"
said
Rostov
laughing.
"And
why
do
you
stand
there
gaping?"
"What
swells
they
are!
Why,
the
water
streams
from
them!
Don't
make
our
drawing
room
so
wet."
"Don't
mess
Mary
Hendrikhovna's
dress!"
cried
other
voices.
Rostov
and
Ilyin
hastened
to
find
a
corner
where
they
could
change
into
dry
clothes
without
offending
Mary
Hendrikhovna's
modesty.
They
were
going
into
a
tiny
recess
behind
a
partition
to
change,
but
found
it
completely
filled
by
three
officers
who
sat
playing
cards
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
on
an
empty
box,
and
these
officers
would
on
no
account
yield
their
position.
Mary
Hendrikhovna
obliged
them
with
the
loan
of
a
petticoat
to
be
used
as
a
curtain,
and
behind
that
screen
Rostov
and
Ilyin,
helped
by
Lavrushka
who
had
brought
their
kits,
changed
their
wet
things
for
dry
ones.
A
fire
was
made
up
in
the
dilapidated
brick
stove.
A
board
was
found,
fixed
on
two
saddles
and
covered
with
a
horsecloth,
a
small
samovar
was
produced
and
a
cellaret
and
half
a
bottle
of
rum,
and
having
asked
Mary
Hendrikhovna
to
preside,
they
all
crowded
round
her.
One
offered
her
a
clean
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
charming
hands,
another
spread
a
jacket
under
her
little
feet
to
keep
them
from
the
damp,
another
hung
his
coat
over
the
window
to
keep
out
the
draft,
and
yet
another
waved
the
flies
off
her
husband's
face,
lest
he
should
wake
up.
"Leave
him
alone,"
said
Mary
Hendrikhovna,
smiling
timidly
and
happily.
"He
is
sleeping
well
as
it
is,
after
a
sleepless
night."
"Oh,
no,
Mary
Hendrikhovna,"
replied
the
officer,
"one
must
look
after
the
doctor.
Perhaps
he'll
take
pity
on
me
someday,
when
it
comes
to
cutting
off
a
leg
or
an
arm
for
me."
There
were
only
three
tumblers,
the
water
was
so
muddy
that
one
could
not
make
out
whether
the
tea
was
strong
or
weak,
and
the
samovar
held
only
six
tumblers
of
water,
but
this
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
to
take
turns
in
order
of
seniority
to
receive
one's
tumbler
from
Mary
Hendrikhovna's
plump
little
hands
with
their
short
and
not
overclean
nails.
All
the
officers
appeared
to
be,
and
really
were,
in
love
with
her
that
evening.
Even
those
playing
cards
behind
the
partition
soon
left
their
game
and
came
over
to
the
samovar,
yielding
to
the
general
mood
of
courting
Mary
Hendrikhovna.
She,
seeing
herself
surrounded
by
such
brilliant
and
polite
young
men,
beamed
with
satisfaction,
try
as
she
might
to
hide
it,
and
perturbed
as
she
evidently
was
each
time
her
husband
moved
in
his
sleep
behind
her.
There
was
only
one
spoon,
sugar
was
more
plentiful
than
anything
else,
but
it
took
too
long
to
dissolve,
so
it
was
decided
that
Mary
Hendrikhovna
should
stir
the
sugar
for
everyone
in
turn.
Rostov
received
his
tumbler,
and
adding
some
rum
to
it
asked
Mary
Hendrikhovna
to
stir
it.
"But
you
take
it
without
sugar?"
she
said,
smiling
all
the
time,
as
if
everything
she
said
and
everything
the
others
said
was
very
amusing
and
had
a
double
meaning.
"It
is
not
the
sugar
I
want,
but
only
that
your
little
hand
should
stir
my
tea."
Mary
Hendrikhovna
assented
and
began
looking
for
the
spoon
which
someone
meanwhile
had
pounced
on.
"Use
your
finger,
Mary
Hendrikhovna,
it
will
be
still
nicer,"
said
Rostov.
"Too
hot!"
she
replied,
blushing
with
pleasure.
Ilyin
put
a
few
drops
of
rum
into
the
bucket
of
water
and
brought
it
to
Mary
Hendrikhovna,
asking
her
to
stir
it
with
her
finger.
"This
is
my
cup,"
said
he.
"Only
dip
your
finger
in
it
and
I'll
drink
it
all
up."
When
they
had
emptied
the
samovar,
Rostov
took
a
pack
of
cards
and
proposed
that
they
should
play
"Kings"
with
Mary
Hendrikhovna.
They
drew
lots
to
settle
who
should
make
up
her
set.
At
Rostov's
suggestion
it
was
agreed
that
whoever
became
"King"
should
have
the
right
to
kiss
Mary
Hendrikhovna's
hand,
and
that
the
"Booby"
should
go
to
refill
and
reheat
the
samovar
for
the
doctor
when
the
latter
awoke.
"Well,
but
supposing
Mary
Hendrikhovna
is
'King'?"
asked
Ilyin.
"As
it
is,
she
is
Queen,
and
her
word
is
law!"
They
had
hardly
begun
to
play
before
the
doctor's
disheveled
head
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
Mary
Hendrikhovna.
He
had
been
awake
for
some
time,
listening
to
what
was
being
said,
and
evidently
found
nothing
entertaining
or
amusing
in
what
was
going
on.
His
face
was
sad
and
depressed.
Without
greeting
the
officers,
he
scratched
himself
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
pass
as
they
were
blocking
the
way.
As
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
all
the
officers
burst
into
loud
laughter
and
Mary
Hendrikhovna
blushed
till
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
thereby
became
still
more
attractive
to
them.
Returning
from
the
yard,
the
doctor
told
his
wife
(who
had
ceased
to
smile
so
happily,
and
looked
at
him
in
alarm,
awaiting
her
sentence)
that
the
rain
had
ceased
and
they
must
go
to
sleep
in
their
covered
cart,
or
everything
in
it
would
be
stolen.
"But
I'll
send
an
orderly....
Two
of
them!"
said
Rostov.
"What
an
idea,
doctor!"
"I'll
stand
guard
on
it
myself!"
said
Ilyin.
"No,
gentlemen,
you
have
had
your
sleep,
but
I
have
not
slept
for
two
nights,"
replied
the
doctor,
and
he
sat
down
morosely
beside
his
wife,
waiting
for
the
game
to
end.
Seeing
his
gloomy
face
as
he
frowned
at
his
wife,
the
officers
grew
still
merrier,
and
some
of
them
could
not
refrain
from
laughter,
for
which
they
hurriedly
sought
plausible
pretexts.
When
he
had
gone,
taking
his
wife
with
him,
and
had
settled
down
with
her
in
their
covered
cart,
the
officers
lay
down
in
the
tavern,
covering
themselves
with
their
wet
cloaks,
but
they
did
not
sleep
for
a
long
time;
now
they
exchanged
remarks,
recalling
the
doctor's
uneasiness
and
his
wife's
delight,
now
they
ran
out
into
the
porch
and
reported
what
was
taking
place
in
the
covered
trap.
Several
times
Rostov,
covering
his
head,
tried
to
go
to
sleep,
but
some
remark
would
arouse
him
and
conversation
would
be
resumed,
to
the
accompaniment
of
unreasoning,
merry,
childlike
laughter.
CHAPTER
XIV
It
was
nearly
three
o'clock
but
no
one
was
yet
asleep,
when
the
quartermaster
appeared
with
an
order
to
move
on
to
the
little
town
of
Ostrovna.
Still
laughing
and
talking,
the
officers
began
hurriedly
getting
ready
and
again
boiled
some
muddy
water
in
the
samovar.
But
Rostov
went
off
to
his
squadron
without
waiting
for
tea.
Day
was
breaking,
the
rain
had
ceased,
and
the
clouds
were
dispersing.
It
felt
damp
and
cold,
especially
in
clothes
that
were
still
moist.
As
they
left
the
tavern
in
the
twilight
of
the
dawn,
Rostov
and
Ilyin
both
glanced
under
the
wet
and
glistening
leather
hood
of
the
doctor's
cart,
from
under
the
apron
of
which
his
feet
were
sticking
out,
and
in
the
middle
of
which
his
wife's
nightcap
was
visible
and
her
sleepy
breathing
audible.
"She
really
is
a
dear
little
thing,"
said
Rostov
to
Ilyin,
who
was
following
him.
"A
charming
woman!"
said
Ilyin,
with
all
the
gravity
of
a
boy
of
sixteen.
Half
an
hour
later
the
squadron
was
lined
up
on
the
road.
The
command
was
heard
to
"mount"
and
the
soldiers
crossed
themselves
and
mounted.
Rostov
riding
in
front
gave
the
order
"Forward!"
and
the
hussars,
with
clanking
sabers
and
subdued
talk,
their
horses'
hoofs
splashing
in
the
mud,
defiled
in
fours
and
moved
along
the
broad
road
planted
with
birch
trees
on
each
side,
following
the
infantry
and
a
battery
that
had
gone
on
in
front.
Tattered,
blue-purple
clouds,
reddening
in
the
east,
were
scudding
before
the
wind.
It
was
growing
lighter
and
lighter.
That
curly
grass
which
always
grows
by
country
roadsides
became
clearly
visible,
still
wet
with
the
night's
rain;
the
drooping
branches
of
the
birches,
also
wet,
swayed
in
the
wind
and
flung
down
bright
drops
of
water
to
one
side.
The
soldiers'
faces
were
more
and
more
clearly
visible.
Rostov,
always
closely
followed
by
Ilyin,
rode
along
the
side
of
the
road
between
two
rows
of
birch
trees.
When
campaigning,
Rostov
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
riding
not
a
regimental
but
a
Cossack
horse.
A
judge
of
horses
and
a
sportsman,
he
had
lately
procured
himself
a
large,
fine,
mettlesome,
Donets
horse,
dun-colored,
with
light
mane
and
tail,
and
when
he
rode
it
no
one
could
outgallop
him.
To
ride
this
horse
was
a
pleasure
to
him,
and
he
thought
of
the
horse,
of
the
morning,
of
the
doctor's
wife,
but
not
once
of
the
impending
danger.
Formerly,
when
going
into
action,
Rostov
had
felt
afraid;
now
he
had
not
the
least
feeling
of
fear.
He
was
fearless,
not
because
he
had
grown
used
to
being
under
fire
(one
cannot
grow
used
to
danger),
but
because
he
had
learned
how
to
manage
his
thoughts
when
in
danger.
He
had
grown
accustomed
when
going
into
action
to
think
about
anything
but
what
would
seem
most
likely
to
interest
him--the
impending
danger.
During
the
first
period
of
his
service,
hard
as
he
tried
and
much
as
he
reproached
himself
with
cowardice,
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
this,
but
with
time
it
had
come
of
itself.
Now
he
rode
beside
Ilyin
under
the
birch
trees,
occasionally
plucking
leaves
from
a
branch
that
met
his
hand,
sometimes
touching
his
horse's
side
with
his
foot,
or,
without
turning
round,
handing
a
pipe
he
had
finished
to
an
hussar
riding
behind
him,
with
as
calm
and
careless
an
air
as
though
he
were
merely
out
for
a
ride.
He
glanced
with
pity
at
the
excited
face
of
Ilyin,
who
talked
much
and
in
great
agitation.
He
knew
from
experience
the
tormenting
expectation
of
terror
and
death
the
cornet
was
suffering
and
knew
that
only
time
could
help
him.
As
soon
as
the
sun
appeared
in
a
clear
strip
of
sky
beneath
the
clouds,
the
wind
fell,
as
if
it
dared
not
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
summer
morning
after
the
storm;
drops
still
continued
to
fall,
but
vertically
now,
and
all
was
still.
The
whole
sun
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
disappeared
behind
a
long
narrow
cloud
that
hung
above
it.
A
few
minutes
later
it
reappeared
brighter
still
from
behind
the
top
of
the
cloud,
tearing
its
edge.
Everything
grew
bright
and
glittered.
And
with
that
light,
and
as
if
in
reply
to
it,
came
the
sound
of
guns
ahead
of
them.
Before
Rostov
had
had
time
to
consider
and
determine
the
distance
of
that
firing,
Count
Ostermann-Tolstoy's
adjutant
came
galloping
from
Vitebsk
with
orders
to
advance
at
a
trot
along
the
road.
The
squadron
overtook
and
passed
the
infantry
and
the
battery--which
had
also
quickened
their
pace--rode
down
a
hill,
and
passing
through
an
empty
and
deserted
village
again
ascended.
The
horses
began
to
lather
and
the
men
to
flush.
"Halt!
Dress
your
ranks!"
the
order
of
the
regimental
commander
was
heard
ahead.
"Forward
by
the
left.
Walk,
march!"
came
the
order
from
in
front.
And
the
hussars,
passing
along
the
line
of
troops
on
the
left
flank
of
our
position,
halted
behind
our
uhlans
who
were
in
the
front
line.
To
the
right
stood
our
infantry
in
a
dense
column:
they
were
the
reserve.
Higher
up
the
hill,
on
the
very
horizon,
our
guns
were
visible
through
the
wonderfully
clear
air,
brightly
illuminated
by
slanting
morning
sunbeams.
In
front,
beyond
a
hollow
dale,
could
be
seen
the
enemy's
columns
and
guns.
Our
advanced
line,
already
in
action,
could
be
heard
briskly
exchanging
shots
with
the
enemy
in
the
dale.
At
these
sounds,
long
unheard,
Rostov's
spirits
rose,
as
at
the
strains
of
the
merriest
music.
Trap-ta-ta-tap!
cracked
the
shots,
now
together,
now
several
quickly
one
after
another.
Again
all
was
silent
and
then
again
it
sounded
as
if
someone
were
walking
on
detonators
and
exploding
them.
The
hussars
remained
in
the
same
place
for
about
an
hour.
A
cannonade
began.
Count
Ostermann
with
his
suite
rode
up
behind
the
squadron,
halted,
spoke
to
the
commander
of
the
regiment,
and
rode
up
the
hill
to
the
guns.
After
Ostermann
had
gone,
a
command
rang
out
to
the
uhlans.
"Form
column!
Prepare
to
charge!"
The
infantry
in
front
of
them
parted
into
platoons
to
allow
the
cavalry
to
pass.
The
uhlans
started,
the
streamers
on
their
spears
fluttering,
and
trotted
downhill
toward
the
French
cavalry
which
was
seen
below
to
the
left.
As
soon
as
the
uhlans
descended
the
hill,
the
hussars
were
ordered
up
the
hill
to
support
the
battery.
As
they
took
the
places
vacated
by
the
uhlans,
bullets
came
from
the
front,
whining
and
whistling,
but
fell
spent
without
taking
effect.
The
sounds,
which
he
had
not
heard
for
so
long,
had
an
even
more
pleasurable
and
exhilarating
effect
on
Rostov
than
the
previous
sounds
of
firing.
Drawing
himself
up,
he
viewed
the
field
of
battle
opening
out
before
him
from
the
hill,
and
with
his
whole
soul
followed
the
movement
of
the
uhlans.
They
swooped
down
close
to
the
French
dragoons,
something
confused
happened
there
amid
the
smoke,
and
five
minutes
later
our
uhlans
were
galloping
back,
not
to
the
place
they
had
occupied
but
more
to
the
left,
and
among
the
orange-colored
uhlans
on
chestnut
horses
and
behind
them,
in
a
large
group,
blue
French
dragoons
on
gray
horses
could
be
seen.
CHAPTER
XV
Rostov,
with
his
keen
sportsman's
eye,
was
one
of
the
first
to
catch
sight
of
these
blue
French
dragoons
pursuing
our
uhlans.
Nearer
and
nearer
in
disorderly
crowds
came
the
uhlans
and
the
French
dragoons
pursuing
them.
He
could
already
see
how
these
men,
who
looked
so
small
at
the
foot
of
the
hill,
jostled
and
overtook
one
another,
waving
their
arms
and
their
sabers
in
the
air.
Rostov
gazed
at
what
was
happening
before
him
as
at
a
hunt.
He
felt
instinctively
that
if
the
hussars
struck
at
the
French
dragoons
now,
the
latter
could
not
withstand
them,
but
if
a
charge
was
to
be
made
it
must
be
done
now,
at
that
very
moment,
or
it
would
be
too
late.
He
looked
around.
A
captain,
standing
beside
him,
was
gazing
like
himself
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
cavalry
below
them.
"Andrew
Sevastyanych!"
said
Rostov.
"You
know,
we
could
crush
them...."
"A
fine
thing
too!"
replied
the
captain,
"and
really..."
Rostov,
without
waiting
to
hear
him
out,
touched
his
horse,
galloped
to
the
front
of
his
squadron,
and
before
he
had
time
to
finish
giving
the
word
of
command,
the
whole
squadron,
sharing
his
feeling,
was
following
him.
Rostov
himself
did
not
know
how
or
why
he
did
it.
He
acted
as
he
did
when
hunting,
without
reflecting
or
considering.
He
saw
the
dragoons
near
and
that
they
were
galloping
in
disorder;
he
knew
they
could
not
withstand
an
attack--knew
there
was
only
that
moment
and
that
if
he
let
it
slip
it
would
not
return.
The
bullets
were
whining
and
whistling
so
stimulatingly
around
him
and
his
horse
was
so
eager
to
go
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself.
He
touched
his
horse,
gave
the
word
of
command,
and
immediately,
hearing
behind
him
the
tramp
of
the
horses
of
his
deployed
squadron,
rode
at
full
trot
downhill
toward
the
dragoons.
Hardly
had
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
before
their
pace
instinctively
changed
to
a
gallop,
which
grew
faster
and
faster
as
they
drew
nearer
to
our
uhlans
and
the
French
dragoons
who
galloped
after
them.
The
dragoons
were
now
close
at
hand.
On
seeing
the
hussars,
the
foremost
began
to
turn,
while
those
behind
began
to
halt.
With
the
same
feeling
with
which
he
had
galloped
across
the
path
of
a
wolf,
Rostov
gave
rein
to
his
Donets
horse
and
galloped
to
intersect
the
path
of
the
dragoons'
disordered
lines.
One
Uhlan
stopped,
another
who
was
on
foot
flung
himself
to
the
ground
to
avoid
being
knocked
over,
and
a
riderless
horse
fell
in
among
the
hussars.
Nearly
all
the
French
dragoons
were
galloping
back.
Rostov,
picking
out
one
on
a
gray
horse,
dashed
after
him.
On
the
way
he
came
upon
a
bush,
his
gallant
horse
cleared
it,
and
almost
before
he
had
righted
himself
in
his
saddle
he
saw
that
he
would
immediately
overtake
the
enemy
he
had
selected.
That
Frenchman,
by
his
uniform
an
officer,
was
going
at
a
gallop,
crouching
on
his
gray
horse
and
urging
it
on
with
his
saber.
In
another
moment
Rostov's
horse
dashed
its
breast
against
the
hindquarters
of
the
officer's
horse,
almost
knocking
it
over,
and
at
the
same
instant
Rostov,
without
knowing
why,
raised
his
saber
and
struck
the
Frenchman
with
it.
The
instant
he
had
done
this,
all
Rostov's
animation
vanished.
The
officer
fell,
not
so
much
from
the
blow--which
had
but
slightly
cut
his
arm
above
the
elbow--as
from
the
shock
to
his
horse
and
from
fright.
Rostov
reined
in
his
horse,
and
his
eyes
sought
his
foe
to
see
whom
he
had
vanquished.
The
French
dragoon
officer
was
hopping
with
one
foot
on
the
ground,
the
other
being
caught
in
the
stirrup.
His
eyes,
screwed
up
with
fear
as
if
he
every
moment
expected
another
blow,
gazed
up
at
Rostov
with
shrinking
terror.
His
pale
and
mud-stained
face--fair
and
young,
with
a
dimple
in
the
chin
and
light-blue
eyes--was
not
an
enemy's
face
at
all
suited
to
a
battlefield,
but
a
most
ordinary,
homelike
face.
Before
Rostov
had
decided
what
to
do
with
him,
the
officer
cried,
"I
surrender!"
He
hurriedly
but
vainly
tried
to
get
his
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
and
did
not
remove
his
frightened
blue
eyes
from
Rostov's
face.
Some
hussars
who
galloped
up
disengaged
his
foot
and
helped
him
into
the
saddle.
On
all
sides,
the
hussars
were
busy
with
the
dragoons;
one
was
wounded,
but
though
his
face
was
bleeding,
he
would
not
give
up
his
horse;
another
was
perched
up
behind
an
hussar
with
his
arms
round
him;
a
third
was
being
helped
by
an
hussar
to
mount
his
horse.
In
front,
the
French
infantry
were
firing
as
they
ran.
The
hussars
galloped
hastily
back
with
their
prisoners.
Rostov
galloped
back
with
the
rest,
aware
of
an
unpleasant
feeling
of
depression
in
his
heart.
Something
vague
and
confused,
which
he
could
not
at
all
account
for,
had
come
over
him
with
the
capture
of
that
officer
and
the
blow
he
had
dealt
him.
Count
Ostermann-Tolstoy
met
the
returning
hussars,
sent
for
Rostov,
thanked
him,
and
said
he
would
report
his
gallant
deed
to
the
Emperor
and
would
recommend
him
for
a
St.
George's
Cross.
When
sent
for
by
Count
Ostermann,
Rostov,
remembering
that
he
had
charged
without
orders,
felt
sure
his
commander
was
sending
for
him
to
punish
him
for
breach
of
discipline.
Ostermann's
flattering
words
and
promise
of
a
reward
should
therefore
have
struck
him
all
the
more
pleasantly,
but
he
still
felt
that
same
vaguely
disagreeable
feeling
of
moral
nausea.
"But
what
on
earth
is
worrying
me?"
he
asked
himself
as
he
rode
back
from
the
general.
"Ilyin?
No,
he's
safe.
Have
I
disgraced
myself
in
any
way?
No,
that's
not
it."
Something
else,
resembling
remorse,
tormented
him.
"Yes,
oh
yes,
that
French
officer
with
the
dimple.
And
I
remember
how
my
arm
paused
when
I
raised
it."
Rostov
saw
the
prisoners
being
led
away
and
galloped
after
them
to
have
a
look
at
his
Frenchman
with
the
dimple
on
his
chin.
He
was
sitting
in
his
foreign
uniform
on
an
hussar
packhorse
and
looked
anxiously
about
him;
The
sword
cut
on
his
arm
could
scarcely
be
called
a
wound.
He
glanced
at
Rostov
with
a
feigned
smile
and
waved
his
hand
in
greeting.
Rostov
still
had
the
same
indefinite
feeling,
as
of
shame.
All
that
day
and
the
next
his
friends
and
comrades
noticed
that
Rostov,
without
being
dull
or
angry,
was
silent,
thoughtful,
and
preoccupied.
He
drank
reluctantly,
tried
to
remain
alone,
and
kept
turning
something
over
in
his
mind.
Rostov
was
always
thinking
about
that
brilliant
exploit
of
his,
which
to
his
amazement
had
gained
him
the
St.
George's
Cross
and
even
given
him
a
reputation
for
bravery,
and
there
was
something
he
could
not
at
all
understand.
"So
others
are
even
more
afraid
than
I
am!"
he
thought.
"So
that's
all
there
is
in
what
is
called
heroism!
And
did
I
do
it
for
my
country's
sake?
And
how
was
he
to
blame,
with
his
dimple
and
blue
eyes?
And
how
frightened
he
was!
He
thought
that
I
should
kill
him.
Why
should
I
kill
him?
My
hand
trembled.
And
they
have
given
me
a
St.
George's
Cross....
I
can't
make
it
out
at
all."
But
while
Nicholas
was
considering
these
questions
and
still
could
reach
no
clear
solution
of
what
puzzled
him
so,
the
wheel
of
fortune
in
the
service,
as
often
happens,
turned
in
his
favor.
After
the
affair
at
Ostrovna
he
was
brought
into
notice,
received
command
of
an
hussar
battalion,
and
when
a
brave
officer
was
needed
he
was
chosen.
CHAPTER
XVI
On
receiving
news
of
Natasha's
illness,
the
countess,
though
not
quite
well
yet
and
still
weak,
went
to
Moscow
with
Petya
and
the
rest
of
the
household,
and
the
whole
family
moved
from
Marya
Dmitrievna's
house
to
their
own
and
settled
down
in
town.
Natasha's
illness
was
so
serious
that,
fortunately
for
her
and
for
her
parents,
the
consideration
of
all
that
had
caused
the
illness,
her
conduct
and
the
breaking
off
of
her
engagement,
receded
into
the
background.
She
was
so
ill
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
consider
in
how
far
she
was
to
blame
for
what
had
happened.
She
could
not
eat
or
sleep,
grew
visibly
thinner,
coughed,
and,
as
the
doctors
made
them
feel,
was
in
danger.
They
could
not
think
of
anything
but
how
to
help
her.
Doctors
came
to
see
her
singly
and
in
consultation,
talked
much
in
French,
German,
and
Latin,
blamed
one
another,
and
prescribed
a
great
variety
of
medicines
for
all
the
diseases
known
to
them,
but
the
simple
idea
never
occurred
to
any
of
them
that
they
could
not
know
the
disease
Natasha
was
suffering
from,
as
no
disease
suffered
by
a
live
man
can
be
known,
for
every
living
person
has
his
own
peculiarities
and
always
has
his
own
peculiar,
personal,
novel,
complicated
disease,
unknown
to
medicine--not
a
disease
of
the
lungs,
liver,
skin,
heart,
nerves,
and
so
on
mentioned
in
medical
books,
but
a
disease
consisting
of
one
of
the
innumerable
combinations
of
the
maladies
of
those
organs.
This
simple
thought
could
not
occur
to
the
doctors
(as
it
cannot
occur
to
a
wizard
that
he
is
unable
to
work
his
charms)
because
the
business
of
their
lives
was
to
cure,
and
they
received
money
for
it
and
had
spent
the
best
years
of
their
lives
on
that
business.
But,
above
all,
that
thought
was
kept
out
of
their
minds
by
the
fact
that
they
saw
they
were
really
useful,
as
in
fact
they
were
to
the
whole
Rostov
family.
Their
usefulness
did
not
depend
on
making
the
patient
swallow
substances
for
the
most
part
harmful
(the
harm
was
scarcely
perceptible,
as
they
were
given
in
small
doses),
but
they
were
useful,
necessary,
and
indispensable
because
they
satisfied
a
mental
need
of
the
invalid
and
of
those
who
loved
her--and
that
is
why
there
are,
and
always
will
be,
pseudo-healers,
wise
women,
homeopaths,
and
allopaths.
They
satisfied
that
eternal
human
need
for
hope
of
relief,
for
sympathy,
and
that
something
should
be
done,
which
is
felt
by
those
who
are
suffering.
They
satisfied
the
need
seen
in
its
most
elementary
form
in
a
child,
when
it
wants
to
have
a
place
rubbed
that
has
been
hurt.
A
child
knocks
itself
and
runs
at
once
to
the
arms
of
its
mother
or
nurse
to
have
the
aching
spot
rubbed
or
kissed,
and
it
feels
better
when
this
is
done.
The
child
cannot
believe
that
the
strongest
and
wisest
of
its
people
have
no
remedy
for
its
pain,
and
the
hope
of
relief
and
the
expression
of
its
mother's
sympathy
while
she
rubs
the
bump
comforts
it.
The
doctors
were
of
use
to
Natasha
because
they
kissed
and
rubbed
her
bump,
assuring
her
that
it
would
soon
pass
if
only
the
coachman
went
to
the
chemist's
in
the
Arbat
and
got
a
powder
and
some
pills
in
a
pretty
box
for
a
ruble
and
seventy
kopeks,
and
if
she
took
those
powders
in
boiled
water
at
intervals
of
precisely
two
hours,
neither
more
nor
less.
What
would
Sonya
and
the
count
and
countess
have
done,
how
would
they
have
looked,
if
nothing
had
been
done,
if
there
had
not
been
those
pills
to
give
by
the
clock,
the
warm
drinks,
the
chicken
cutlets,
and
all
the
other
details
of
life
ordered
by
the
doctors,
the
carrying
out
of
which
supplied
an
occupation
and
consolation
to
the
family
circle?
How
would
the
count
have
borne
his
dearly
loved
daughter's
illness
had
he
not
known
that
it
was
costing
him
a
thousand
rubles,
and
that
he
would
not
grudge
thousands
more
to
benefit
her,
or
had
he
not
known
that
if
her
illness
continued
he
would
not
grudge
yet
other
thousands
and
would
take
her
abroad
for
consultations
there,
and
had
he
not
been
able
to
explain
the
details
of
how
Metivier
and
Feller
had
not
understood
the
symptoms,
but
Frise
had,
and
Mudrov
had
diagnosed
them
even
better?
What
would
the
countess
have
done
had
she
not
been
able
sometimes
to
scold
the
invalid
for
not
strictly
obeying
the
doctor's
orders?
"You'll
never
get
well
like
that,"
she
would
say,
forgetting
her
grief
in
her
vexation,
"if
you
won't
obey
the
doctor
and
take
your
medicine
at
the
right
time!
You
mustn't
trifle
with
it,
you
know,
or
it
may
turn
to
pneumonia,"
she
would
go
on,
deriving
much
comfort
from
the
utterance
of
that
foreign
word,
incomprehensible
to
others
as
well
as
to
herself.
What
would
Sonya
have
done
without
the
glad
consciousness
that
she
had
not
undressed
during
the
first
three
nights,
in
order
to
be
ready
to
carry
out
all
the
doctor's
injunctions
with
precision,
and
that
she
still
kept
awake
at
night
so
as
not
to
miss
the
proper
time
when
the
slightly
harmful
pills
in
the
little
gilt
box
had
to
be
administered?
Even
to
Natasha
herself
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
so
many
sacrifices
were
being
made
for
her
sake,
and
to
know
that
she
had
to
take
medicine
at
certain
hours,
though
she
declared
that
no
medicine
would
cure
her
and
that
it
was
all
nonsense.
And
it
was
even
pleasant
to
be
able
to
show,
by
disregarding
the
orders,
that
she
did
not
believe
in
medical
treatment
and
did
not
value
her
life.
The
doctor
came
every
day,
felt
her
pulse,
looked
at
her
tongue,
and
regardless
of
her
grief-stricken
face
joked
with
her.
But
when
he
had
gone
into
another
room,
to
which
the
countess
hurriedly
followed
him,
he
assumed
a
grave
air
and
thoughtfully
shaking
his
head
said
that
though
there
was
danger,
he
had
hopes
of
the
effect
of
this
last
medicine
and
one
must
wait
and
see,
that
the
malady
was
chiefly
mental,
but...
And
the
countess,
trying
to
conceal
the
action
from
herself
and
from
him,
slipped
a
gold
coin
into
his
hand
and
always
returned
to
the
patient
with
a
more
tranquil
mind.
The
symptoms
of
Natasha's
illness
were
that
she
ate
little,
slept
little,
coughed,
and
was
always
low-spirited.
The
doctors
said
that
she
could
not
get
on
without
medical
treatment,
so
they
kept
her
in
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
town,
and
the
Rostovs
did
not
move
to
the
country
that
summer
of
1812.
In
spite
of
the
many
pills
she
swallowed
and
the
drops
and
powders
out
of
the
little
bottles
and
boxes
of
which
Madame
Schoss
who
was
fond
of
such
things
made
a
large
collection,
and
in
spite
of
being
deprived
of
the
country
life
to
which
she
was
accustomed,
youth
prevailed.
Natasha's
grief
began
to
be
overlaid
by
the
impressions
of
daily
life,
it
ceased
to
press
so
painfully
on
her
heart,
it
gradually
faded
into
the
past,
and
she
began
to
recover
physically.
CHAPTER
XVII
Natasha
was
calmer
but
no
happier.
She
not
merely
avoided
all
external
forms
of
pleasure--balls,
promenades,
concerts,
and
theaters--but
she
never
laughed
without
a
sound
of
tears
in
her
laughter.
She
could
not
sing.
As
soon
as
she
began
to
laugh,
or
tried
to
sing
by
herself,
tears
choked
her:
tears
of
remorse,
tears
at
the
recollection
of
those
pure
times
which
could
never
return,
tears
of
vexation
that
she
should
so
uselessly
have
ruined
her
young
life
which
might
have
been
so
happy.
Laughter
and
singing
in
particular
seemed
to
her
like
a
blasphemy,
in
face
of
her
sorrow.
Without
any
need
of
self-restraint,
no
wish
to
coquet
ever
entered
her
head.
She
said
and
felt
at
that
time
that
no
man
was
more
to
her
than
Nastasya
Ivanovna,
the
buffoon.
Something
stood
sentinel
within
her
and
forbade
her
every
joy.
Besides,
she
had
lost
all
the
old
interests
of
her
carefree
girlish
life
that
had
been
so
full
of
hope.
The
previous
autumn,
the
hunting,
"Uncle,"
and
the
Christmas
holidays
spent
with
Nicholas
at
Otradnoe
were
what
she
recalled
oftenest
and
most
painfully.
What
would
she
not
have
given
to
bring
back
even
a
single
day
of
that
time!
But
it
was
gone
forever.
Her
presentiment
at
the
time
had
not
deceived
her--that
that
state
of
freedom
and
readiness
for
any
enjoyment
would
not
return
again.
Yet
it
was
necessary
to
live
on.
It
comforted
her
to
reflect
that
she
was
not
better
as
she
had
formerly
imagined,
but
worse,
much
worse,
than
anybody
else
in
the
world.
But
this
was
not
enough.
She
knew
that,
and
asked
herself,
"What
next?"
But
there
was
nothing
to
come.
There
was
no
joy
in
life,
yet
life
was
passing.
Natasha
apparently
tried
not
to
be
a
burden
or
a
hindrance
to
anyone,
but
wanted
nothing
for
herself.
She
kept
away
from
everyone
in
the
house
and
felt
at
ease
only
with
her
brother
Petya.
She
liked
to
be
with
him
better
than
with
the
others,
and
when
alone
with
him
she
sometimes
laughed.
She
hardly
ever
left
the
house
and
of
those
who
came
to
see
them
was
glad
to
see
only
one
person,
Pierre.
It
would
have
been
impossible
to
treat
her
with
more
delicacy,
greater
care,
and
at
the
same
time
more
seriously
than
did
Count
Bezukhov.
Natasha
unconsciously
felt
this
delicacy
and
so
found
great
pleasure
in
his
society.
But
she
was
not
even
grateful
to
him
for
it;
nothing
good
on
Pierre's
part
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
effort,
it
seemed
so
natural
for
him
to
be
kind
to
everyone
that
there
was
no
merit
in
his
kindness.
Sometimes
Natasha
noticed
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
on
his
part
in
her
presence,
especially
when
he
wanted
to
do
something
to
please
her,
or
feared
that
something
they
spoke
of
would
awaken
memories
distressing
to
her.
She
noticed
this
and
attributed
it
to
his
general
kindness
and
shyness,
which
she
imagined
must
be
the
same
toward
everyone
as
it
was
to
her.
After
those
involuntary
words--that
if
he
were
free
he
would
have
asked
on
his
knees
for
her
hand
and
her
love--uttered
at
a
moment
when
she
was
so
strongly
agitated,
Pierre
never
spoke
to
Natasha
of
his
feelings;
and
it
seemed
plain
to
her
that
those
words,
which
had
then
so
comforted
her,
were
spoken
as
all
sorts
of
meaningless
words
are
spoken
to
comfort
a
crying
child.
It
was
not
because
Pierre
was
a
married
man,
but
because
Natasha
felt
very
strongly
with
him
that
moral
barrier
the
absence
of
which
she
had
experienced
with
Kuragin
that
it
never
entered
her
head
that
the
relations
between
him
and
herself
could
lead
to
love
on
her
part,
still
less
on
his,
or
even
to
the
kind
of
tender,
self-conscious,
romantic
friendship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
of
which
she
had
known
several
instances.
Before
the
end
of
the
fast
of
St.
Peter,
Agrafena
Ivanovna
Belova,
a
country
neighbor
of
the
Rostovs,
came
to
Moscow
to
pay
her
devotions
at
the
shrines
of
the
Moscow
saints.
She
suggested
that
Natasha
should
fast
and
prepare
for
Holy
Communion,
and
Natasha
gladly
welcomed
the
idea.
Despite
the
doctor's
orders
that
she
should
not
go
out
early
in
the
morning,
Natasha
insisted
on
fasting
and
preparing
for
the
sacrament,
not
as
they
generally
prepared
for
it
in
the
Rostov
family
by
attending
three
services
in
their
own
house,
but
as
Agrafena
Ivanovna
did,
by
going
to
church
every
day
for
a
week
and
not
once
missing
Vespers,
Matins,
or
Mass.
The
countess
was
pleased
with
Natasha's
zeal;
after
the
poor
results
of
the
medical
treatment,
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
she
hoped
that
prayer
might
help
her
daughter
more
than
medicines
and,
though
not
without
fear
and
concealing
it
from
the
doctor,
she
agreed
to
Natasha's
wish
and
entrusted
her
to
Belova.
Agrafena
Ivanovna
used
to
come
to
wake
Natasha
at
three
in
the
morning,
but
generally
found
her
already
awake.
She
was
afraid
of
being
late
for
Matins.
Hastily
washing,
and
meekly
putting
on
her
shabbiest
dress
and
an
old
mantilla,
Natasha,
shivering
in
the
fresh
air,
went
out
into
the
deserted
streets
lit
by
the
clear
light
of
dawn.
By
Agrafena
Ivanovna's
advice
Natasha
prepared
herself
not
in
their
own
parish,
but
at
a
church
where,
according
to
the
devout
Agrafena
Ivanovna,
the
priest
was
a
man
of
very
severe
and
lofty
life.
There
were
never
many
people
in
the
church;
Natasha
always
stood
beside
Belova
in
the
customary
place
before
an
icon
of
the
Blessed
Virgin,
let
into
the
screen
before
the
choir
on
the
left
side,
and
a
feeling,
new
to
her,
of
humility
before
something
great
and
incomprehensible,
seized
her
when
at
that
unusual
morning
hour,
gazing
at
the
dark
face
of
the
Virgin
illuminated
by
the
candles
burning
before
it
and
by
the
morning
light
falling
from
the
window,
she
listened
to
the
words
of
the
service
which
she
tried
to
follow
with
understanding.
When
she
understood
them
her
personal
feeling
became
interwoven
in
the
prayers
with
shades
of
its
own.
When
she
did
not
understand,
it
was
sweeter
still
to
think
that
the
wish
to
understand
everything
is
pride,
that
it
is
impossible
to
understand
all,
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
believe
and
to
commit
oneself
to
God,
whom
she
felt
guiding
her
soul
at
those
moments.
She
crossed
herself,
bowed
low,
and
when
she
did
not
understand,
in
horror
at
her
own
vileness,
simply
asked
God
to
forgive
her
everything,
everything,
to
have
mercy
upon
her.
The
prayers
to
which
she
surrendered
herself
most
of
all
were
those
of
repentance.
On
her
way
home
at
an
early
hour
when
she
met
no
one
but
bricklayers
going
to
work
or
men
sweeping
the
street,
and
everybody
within
the
houses
was
still
asleep,
Natasha
experienced
a
feeling
new
to
her,
a
sense
of
the
possibility
of
correcting
her
faults,
the
possibility
of
a
new,
clean
life,
and
of
happiness.
During
the
whole
week
she
spent
in
this
way,
that
feeling
grew
every
day.
And
the
happiness
of
taking
communion,
or
"communing"
as
Agrafena
Ivanovna,
joyously
playing
with
the
word,
called
it,
seemed
to
Natasha
so
great
that
she
felt
she
should
never
live
till
that
blessed
Sunday.
But
the
happy
day
came,
and
on
that
memorable
Sunday,
when,
dressed
in
white
muslin,
she
returned
home
after
communion,
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
felt
calm
and
not
oppressed
by
the
thought
of
the
life
that
lay
before
her.
The
doctor
who
came
to
see
her
that
day
ordered
her
to
continue
the
powders
he
had
prescribed
a
fortnight
previously.
"She
must
certainly
go
on
taking
them
morning
and
evening,"
said
he,
evidently
sincerely
satisfied
with
his
success.
"Only,
please
be
particular
about
it.
"Be
quite
easy,"
he
continued
playfully,
as
he
adroitly
took
the
gold
coin
in
his
palm.
"She
will
soon
be
singing
and
frolicking
about.
The
last
medicine
has
done
her
a
very
great
deal
of
good.
She
has
freshened
up
very
much."
The
countess,
with
a
cheerful
expression
on
her
face,
looked
down
at
her
nails
and
spat
a
little
for
luck
as
she
returned
to
the
drawing
room.
CHAPTER
XVIII
At
the
beginning
of
July
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
about
the
war
began
to
spread
in
Moscow;
people
spoke
of
an
appeal
by
the
Emperor
to
the
people,
and
of
his
coming
himself
from
the
army
to
Moscow.
And
as
up
to
the
eleventh
of
July
no
manifesto
or
appeal
had
been
received,
exaggerated
reports
became
current
about
them
and
about
the
position
of
Russia.
It
was
said
that
the
Emperor
was
leaving
the
army
because
it
was
in
danger,
it
was
said
that
Smolensk
had
surrendered,
that
Napoleon
had
an
army
of
a
million
and
only
a
miracle
could
save
Russia.
On
the
eleventh
of
July,
which
was
Saturday,
the
manifesto
was
received
but
was
not
yet
in
print,
and
Pierre,
who
was
at
the
Rostovs',
promised
to
come
to
dinner
next
day,
Sunday,
and
bring
a
copy
of
the
manifesto
and
appeal,
which
he
would
obtain
from
Count
Rostopchin.
That
Sunday,
the
Rostovs
went
to
Mass
at
the
Razumovskis'
private
chapel
as
usual.
It
was
a
hot
July
day.
Even
at
ten
o'clock,
when
the
Rostovs
got
out
of
their
carriage
at
the
chapel,
the
sultry
air,
the
shouts
of
hawkers,
the
light
and
gay
summer
clothes
of
the
crowd,
the
dusty
leaves
of
the
trees
on
the
boulevard,
the
sounds
of
the
band
and
the
white
trousers
of
a
battalion
marching
to
parade,
the
rattling
of
wheels
on
the
cobblestones,
and
the
brilliant,
hot
sunshine
were
all
full
of
that
summer
languor,
that
content
and
discontent
with
the
present,
which
is
most
strongly
felt
on
a
bright,
hot
day
in
town.
All
the
Moscow
notabilities,
all
the
Rostovs'
acquaintances,
were
at
the
Razumovskis'
chapel,
for,
as
if
expecting
something
to
happen,
many
wealthy
families
who
usually
left
town
for
their
country
estates
had
not
gone
away
that
summer.
As
Natasha,
at
her
mother's
side,
passed
through
the
crowd
behind
a
liveried
footman
who
cleared
the
way
for
them,
she
heard
a
young
man
speaking
about
her
in
too
loud
a
whisper.
"That's
Rostova,
the
one
who..."
"She's
much
thinner,
but
all
the
same
she's
pretty!"
She
heard,
or
thought
she
heard,
the
names
of
Kuragin
and
Bolkonski.
But
she
was
always
imagining
that.
It
always
seemed
to
her
that
everyone
who
looked
at
her
was
thinking
only
of
what
had
happened
to
her.
With
a
sinking
heart,
wretched
as
she
always
was
now
when
she
found
herself
in
a
crowd,
Natasha
in
her
lilac
silk
dress
trimmed
with
black
lace
walked-
-as
women
can
walk--with
the
more
repose
and
stateliness
the
greater
the
pain
and
shame
in
her
soul.
She
knew
for
certain
that
she
was
pretty,
but
this
no
longer
gave
her
satisfaction
as
it
used
to.
On
the
contrary
it
tormented
her
more
than
anything
else
of
late,
and
particularly
so
on
this
bright,
hot
summer
day
in
town.
"It's
Sunday
again--another
week
past,"
she
thought,
recalling
that
she
had
been
here
the
Sunday
before,
"and
always
the
same
life
that
is
no
life,
and
the
same
surroundings
in
which
it
used
to
be
so
easy
to
live.
I'm
pretty,
I'm
young,
and
I
know
that
now
I
am
good.
I
used
to
be
bad,
but
now
I
know
I
am
good,"
she
thought,
"but
yet
my
best
years
are
slipping
by
and
are
no
good
to
anyone."
She
stood
by
her
mother's
side
and
exchanged
nods
with
acquaintances
near
her.
From
habit
she
scrutinized
the
ladies'
dresses,
condemned
the
bearing
of
a
lady
standing
close
by
who
was
not
crossing
herself
properly
but
in
a
cramped
manner,
and
again
she
thought
with
vexation
that
she
was
herself
being
judged
and
was
judging
others,
and
suddenly,
at
the
sound
of
the
service,
she
felt
horrified
at
her
own
vileness,
horrified
that
the
former
purity
of
her
soul
was
again
lost
to
her.
A
comely,
fresh-looking
old
man
was
conducting
the
service
with
that
mild
solemnity
which
has
so
elevating
and
soothing
an
effect
on
the
souls
of
the
worshipers.
The
gates
of
the
sanctuary
screen
were
closed,
the
curtain
was
slowly
drawn,
and
from
behind
it
a
soft
mysterious
voice
pronounced
some
words.
Tears,
the
cause
of
which
she
herself
did
not
understand,
made
Natasha's
breast
heave,
and
a
joyous
but
oppressive
feeling
agitated
her.
"Teach
me
what
I
should
do,
how
to
live
my
life,
how
I
may
grow
good
forever,
forever!"
she
pleaded.
The
deacon
came
out
onto
the
raised
space
before
the
altar
screen
and,
holding
his
thumb
extended,
drew
his
long
hair
from
under
his
dalmatic
and,
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
breast,
began
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
to
recite
the
words
of
the
prayer...
"In
peace
let
us
pray
unto
the
Lord."
"As
one
community,
without
distinction
of
class,
without
enmity,
united
by
brotherly
love--let
us
pray!"
thought
Natasha.
"For
the
peace
that
is
from
above,
and
for
the
salvation
of
our
souls."
"For
the
world
of
angels
and
all
the
spirits
who
dwell
above
us,"
prayed
Natasha.
When
they
prayed
for
the
warriors,
she
thought
of
her
brother
and
Denisov.
When
they
prayed
for
all
traveling
by
land
and
sea,
she
remembered
Prince
Andrew,
prayed
for
him,
and
asked
God
to
forgive
her
all
the
wrongs
she
had
done
him.
When
they
prayed
for
those
who
love
us,
she
prayed
for
the
members
of
her
own
family,
her
father
and
mother
and
Sonya,
realizing
for
the
first
time
how
wrongly
she
had
acted
toward
them,
and
feeling
all
the
strength
of
her
love
for
them.
When
they
prayed
for
those
who
hate
us,
she
tried
to
think
of
her
enemies
and
people
who
hated
her,
in
order
to
pray
for
them.
She
included
among
her
enemies
the
creditors
and
all
who
had
business
dealings
with
her
father,
and
always
at
the
thought
of
enemies
and
those
who
hated
her
she
remembered
Anatole
who
had
done
her
so
much
harm--and
though
he
did
not
hate
her
she
gladly
prayed
for
him
as
for
an
enemy.
Only
at
prayer
did
she
feel
able
to
think
clearly
and
calmly
of
Prince
Andrew
and
Anatole,
as
men
for
whom
her
feelings
were
as
nothing
compared
with
her
awe
and
devotion
to
God.
When
they
prayed
for
the
Imperial
family
and
the
Synod,
she
bowed
very
low
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross,
saying
to
herself
that
even
if
she
did
not
understand,
still
she
could
not
doubt,
and
at
any
rate
loved
the
governing
Synod
and
prayed
for
it.
When
he
had
finished
the
Litany
the
deacon
crossed
the
stole
over
his
breast
and
said,
"Let
us
commit
ourselves
and
our
whole
lives
to
Christ
the
Lord!"
"Commit
ourselves
to
God,"
Natasha
inwardly
repeated.
"Lord
God,
I
submit
myself
to
Thy
will!"
she
thought.
"I
want
nothing,
wish
for
nothing;
teach
me
what
to
do
and
how
to
use
my
will!
Take
me,
take
me!"
prayed
Natasha,
with
impatient
emotion
in
her
heart,
not
crossing
herself
but
letting
her
slender
arms
hang
down
as
if
expecting
some
invisible
power
at
any
moment
to
take
her
and
deliver
her
from
herself,
from
her
regrets,
desires,
remorse,
hopes,
and
sins.
The
countess
looked
round
several
times
at
her
daughter's
softened
face
and
shining
eyes
and
prayed
God
to
help
her.
Unexpectedly,
in
the
middle
of
the
service,
and
not
in
the
usual
order
Natasha
knew
so
well,
the
deacon
brought
out
a
small
stool,
the
one
he
knelt
on
when
praying
on
Trinity
Sunday,
and
placed
it
before
the
doors
of
the
sanctuary
screen.
The
priest
came
out
with
his
purple
velvet
biretta
on
his
head,
adjusted
his
hair,
and
knelt
down
with
an
effort.
Everybody
followed
his
example
and
they
looked
at
one
another
in
surprise.
Then
came
the
prayer
just
received
from
the
Synod--a
prayer
for
the
deliverance
of
Russia
from
hostile
invasion.
"Lord
God
of
might,
God
of
our
salvation!"
began
the
priest
in
that
voice,
clear,
not
grandiloquent
but
mild,
in
which
only
the
Slav
clergy
read
and
which
acts
so
irresistibly
on
a
Russian
heart.
"Lord
God
of
might,
God
of
our
salvation!
Look
this
day
in
mercy
and
blessing
on
Thy
humble
people,
and
graciously
hear
us,
spare
us,
and
have
mercy
upon
us!
This
foe
confounding
Thy
land,
desiring
to
lay
waste
the
whole
world,
rises
against
us;
these
lawless
men
are
gathered
together
to
overthrow
Thy
kingdom,
to
destroy
Thy
dear
Jerusalem,
Thy
beloved
Russia;
to
defile
Thy
temples,
to
overthrow
Thine
altars,
and
to
desecrate
our
holy
shrines.
How
long,
O
Lord,
how
long
shall
the
wicked
triumph?
How
long
shall
they
wield
unlawful
power?
"Lord
God!
Hear
us
when
we
pray
to
Thee;
strengthen
with
Thy
might
our
most
gracious
sovereign
lord,
the
Emperor
Alexander
Pavlovich;
be
mindful
of
his
uprightness
and
meekness,
reward
him
according
to
his
righteousness,
and
let
it
preserve
us,
Thy
chosen
Israel!
Bless
his
counsels,
his
undertakings,
and
his
work;
strengthen
his
kingdom
by
Thine
almighty
hand,
and
give
him
victory
over
his
enemy,
even
as
Thou
gavest
Moses
the
victory
over
Amalek,
Gideon
over
Midian,
and
David
over
Goliath.
Preserve
his
army,
put
a
bow
of
brass
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
armed
themselves
in
Thy
Name,
and
gird
their
loins
with
strength
for
the
fight.
Take
up
the
spear
and
shield
and
arise
to
help
us;
confound
and
put
to
shame
those
who
have
devised
evil
against
us,
may
they
be
before
the
faces
of
Thy
faithful
warriors
as
dust
before
the
wind,
and
may
Thy
mighty
Angel
confound
them
and
put
them
to
flight;
may
they
be
ensnared
when
they
know
it
not,
and
may
the
plots
they
have
laid
in
secret
be
turned
against
them;
let
them
fall
before
Thy
servants'
feet
and
be
laid
low
by
our
hosts!
Lord,
Thou
art
able
to
save
both
great
and
small;
Thou
art
God,
and
man
cannot
prevail
against
Thee!
"God
of
our
fathers!
Remember
Thy
bounteous
mercy
and
loving-kindness
which
are
from
of
old;
turn
not
Thy
face
from
us,
but
be
gracious
to
our
unworthiness,
and
in
Thy
great
goodness
and
Thy
many
mercies
regard
not
our
transgressions
and
iniquities!
Create
in
us
a
clean
heart
and
renew
a
right
spirit
within
us,
strengthen
us
all
in
Thy
faith,
fortify
our
hope,
inspire
us
with
true
love
one
for
another,
arm
us
with
unity
of
spirit
in
the
righteous
defense
of
the
heritage
Thou
gavest
to
us
and
to
our
fathers,
and
let
not
the
scepter
of
the
wicked
be
exalted
against
the
destiny
of
those
Thou
hast
sanctified.
"O
Lord
our
God,
in
whom
we
believe
and
in
whom
we
put
our
trust,
let
us
not
be
confounded
in
our
hope
of
Thy
mercy,
and
give
us
a
token
of
Thy
blessing,
that
those
who
hate
us
and
our
Orthodox
faith
may
see
it
and
be
put
to
shame
and
perish,
and
may
all
the
nations
know
that
Thou
art
the
Lord
and
we
are
Thy
people.
Show
Thy
mercy
upon
us
this
day,
O
Lord,
and
grant
us
Thy
salvation;
make
the
hearts
of
Thy
servants
to
rejoice
in
Thy
mercy;
smite
down
our
enemies
and
destroy
them
swiftly
beneath
the
feet
of
Thy
faithful
servants!
For
Thou
art
the
defense,
the
succor,
and
the
victory
of
them
that
put
their
trust
in
Thee,
and
to
Thee
be
all
glory,
to
Father,
Son,
and
Holy
Ghost,
now
and
forever,
world
without
end.
Amen."
In
Natasha's
receptive
condition
of
soul
this
prayer
affected
her
strongly.
She
listened
to
every
word
about
the
victory
of
Moses
over
Amalek,
of
Gideon
over
Midian,
and
of
David
over
Goliath,
and
about
the
destruction
of
"Thy
Jerusalem,"
and
she
prayed
to
God
with
the
tenderness
and
emotion
with
which
her
heart
was
overflowing,
but
without
fully
understanding
what
she
was
asking
of
God
in
that
prayer.
She
shared
with
all
her
heart
in
the
prayer
for
the
spirit
of
righteousness,
for
the
strengthening
of
the
heart
by
faith
and
hope,
and
its
animation
by
love.
But
she
could
not
pray
that
her
enemies
might
be
trampled
under
foot
when
but
a
few
minutes
before
she
had
been
wishing
she
had
more
of
them
that
she
might
pray
for
them.
But
neither
could
she
doubt
the
righteousness
of
the
prayer
that
was
being
read
on
bended
knees.
She
felt
in
her
heart
a
devout
and
tremulous
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
punishment
that
overtakes
men
for
their
sins,
and
especially
of
her
own
sins,
and
she
prayed
to
God
to
forgive
them
all,
and
her
too,
and
to
give
them
all,
and
her
too,
peace
and
happiness.
And
it
seemed
to
her
that
God
heard
her
prayer.
CHAPTER
XIX
From
the
day
when
Pierre,
after
leaving
the
Rostovs'
with
Natasha's
grateful
look
fresh
in
his
mind,
had
gazed
at
the
comet
that
seemed
to
be
fixed
in
the
sky
and
felt
that
something
new
was
appearing
on
his
own
horizon--from
that
day
the
problem
of
the
vanity
and
uselessness
of
all
earthly
things,
that
had
incessantly
tormented
him,
no
longer
presented
itself.
That
terrible
question
"Why?"
"Wherefore?"
which
had
come
to
him
amid
every
occupation,
was
now
replaced,
not
by
another
question
or
by
a
reply
to
the
former
question,
but
by
her
image.
When
he
listened
to,
or
himself
took
part
in,
trivial
conversations,
when
he
read
or
heard
of
human
baseness
or
folly,
he
was
not
horrified
as
formerly,
and
did
not
ask
himself
why
men
struggled
so
about
these
things
when
all
is
so
transient
and
incomprehensible--but
he
remembered
her
as
he
had
last
seen
her,
and
all
his
doubts
vanished--not
because
she
had
answered
the
questions
that
had
haunted
him,
but
because
his
conception
of
her
transferred
him
instantly
to
another,
a
brighter,
realm
of
spiritual
activity
in
which
no
one
could
be
justified
or
guilty--a
realm
of
beauty
and
love
which
it
was
worth
living
for.
Whatever
worldly
baseness
presented
itself
to
him,
he
said
to
himself:
"Well,
supposing
N.
N.
swindled
the
country
and
the
Tsar,
and
the
country
and
the
Tsar
confer
honors
upon
him,
what
does
that
matter?
She
smiled
at
me
yesterday
and
asked
me
to
come
again,
and
I
love
her,
and
no
one
will
ever
know
it."
And
his
soul
felt
calm
and
peaceful.
Pierre
still
went
into
society,
drank
as
much
and
led
the
same
idle
and
dissipated
life,
because
besides
the
hours
he
spent
at
the
Rostovs'
there
were
other
hours
he
had
to
spend
somehow,
and
the
habits
and
acquaintances
he
had
made
in
Moscow
formed
a
current
that
bore
him
along
irresistibly.
But
latterly,
when
more
and
more
disquieting
reports
came
from
the
seat
of
war
and
Natasha's
health
began
to
improve
and
she
no
longer
aroused
in
him
the
former
feeling
of
careful
pity,
an
ever-
increasing
restlessness,
which
he
could
not
explain,
took
possession
of
him.
He
felt
that
the
condition
he
was
in
could
not
continue
long,
that
a
catastrophe
was
coming
which
would
change
his
whole
life,
and
he
impatiently
sought
everywhere
for
signs
of
that
approaching
catastrophe.
One
of
his
brother
Masons
had
revealed
to
Pierre
the
following
prophecy
concerning
Napoleon,
drawn
from
the
Revelation
of
St.
John.
In
chapter
13,
verse
18,
of
the
Apocalypse,
it
is
said:
Here
is
wisdom.
Let
him
that
hath
understanding
count
the
number
of
the
beast:
for
it
is
the
number
of
a
man;
and
his
number
is
Six
hundred
threescore
and
six.
And
in
the
fifth
verse
of
the
same
chapter:
And
there
was
given
unto
him
a
mouth
speaking
great
things
and
blasphemies;
and
power
was
given
unto
him
to
continue
forty
and
two
months.
The
French
alphabet,
written
out
with
the
same
numerical
values
as
the
Hebrew,
in
which
the
first
nine
letters
denote
units
and
the
others
tens,
will
have
the
following
significance:

Writing
the
words
L'Empereur
Napoleon
in
numbers,
it
appears
that
the
sum
of
them
is
666,
and
that
Napoleon
was
therefore
the
beast
foretold
in
the
Apocalypse.
Moreover,
by
applying
the
same
system
to
the
words
quarante-deux,
*
which
was
the
term
allowed
to
the
beast
that
"spoke
great
things
and
blasphemies,"
the
same
number
666
was
obtained;
from
which
it
followed
that
the
limit
fixed
for
Napoleon's
power
had
come
in
the
year
1812
when
the
French
emperor
was
forty-two.
This
prophecy
pleased
Pierre
very
much
and
he
often
asked
himself
what
would
put
an
end
to
the
power
of
the
beast,
that
is,
of
Napoleon,
and
tried
by
the
same
system
of
using
letters
as
numbers
and
adding
them
up,
to
find
an
answer
to
the
question
that
engrossed
him.
He
wrote
the
words
L'Empereur
Alexandre,
La
nation
russe
and
added
up
their
numbers,
but
the
sums
were
either
more
or
less
than
666.
Once
when
making
such
calculations
he
wrote
down
his
own
name
in
French,
Comte
Pierre
Besouhoff,
but
the
sum
of
the
numbers
did
not
come
right.
Then
he
changed
the
spelling,
substituting
a
z
for
the
s
and
adding
de
and
the
article
le,
still
without
obtaining
the
desired
result.
Then
it
occurred
to
him:
if
the
answer
to
the
question
were
contained
in
his
name,
his
nationality
would
also
be
given
in
the
answer.
So
he
wrote
Le
russe
Besuhof
and
adding
up
the
numbers
got
671.
This
was
only
five
too
much,
and
five
was
represented
by
e,
the
very
letter
elided
from
the
article
le
before
the
word
Empereur.
By
omitting
the
e,
though
incorrectly,
Pierre
got
the
answer
he
sought.
L'russe
Besuhof
made
666.
This
discovery
excited
him.
How,
or
by
what
means,
he
was
connected
with
the
great
event
foretold
in
the
Apocalypse
he
did
not
know,
but
he
did
not
doubt
that
connection
for
a
moment.
His
love
for
Natasha,
Antichrist,
Napoleon,
the
invasion,
the
comet,
666,
L'Empereur
Napoleon,
and
L'russe
Besuhof--all
this
had
to
mature
and
culminate,
to
lift
him
out
of
that
spellbound,
petty
sphere
of
Moscow
habits
in
which
he
felt
himself
held
captive
and
lead
him
to
a
great
achievement
and
great
happiness.
*
Forty-two.
On
the
eve
of
the
Sunday
when
the
special
prayer
was
read,
Pierre
had
promised
the
Rostovs
to
bring
them,
from
Count
Rostopchin
whom
he
knew
well,
both
the
appeal
to
the
people
and
the
news
from
the
army.
In
the
morning,
when
he
went
to
call
at
Rostopchin's
he
met
there
a
courier
fresh
from
the
army,
an
acquaintance
of
his
own,
who
often
danced
at
Moscow
balls.
"Do,
please,
for
heaven's
sake,
relieve
me
of
something!"
said
the
courier.
"I
have
a
sackful
of
letters
to
parents."
Among
these
letters
was
one
from
Nicholas
Rostov
to
his
father.
Pierre
took
that
letter,
and
Rostopchin
also
gave
him
the
Emperor's
appeal
to
Moscow,
which
had
just
been
printed,
the
last
army
orders,
and
his
own
most
recent
bulletin.
Glancing
through
the
army
orders,
Pierre
found
in
one
of
them,
in
the
lists
of
killed,
wounded,
and
rewarded,
the
name
of
Nicholas
Rostov,
awarded
a
St.
George's
Cross
of
the
Fourth
Class
for
courage
shown
in
the
Ostrovna
affair,
and
in
the
same
order
the
name
of
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski,
appointed
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
of
Chasseurs.
Though
he
did
not
want
to
remind
the
Rostovs
of
Bolkonski,
Pierre
could
not
refrain
from
making
them
happy
by
the
news
of
their
son's
having
received
a
decoration,
so
he
sent
that
printed
army
order
and
Nicholas'
letter
to
the
Rostovs,
keeping
the
appeal,
the
bulletin,
and
the
other
orders
to
take
with
him
when
he
went
to
dinner.
His
conversation
with
Count
Rostopchin
and
the
latter's
tone
of
anxious
hurry,
the
meeting
with
the
courier
who
talked
casually
of
how
badly
things
were
going
in
the
army,
the
rumors
of
the
discovery
of
spies
in
Moscow
and
of
a
leaflet
in
circulation
stating
that
Napoleon
promised
to
be
in
both
the
Russian
capitals
by
the
autumn,
and
the
talk
of
the
Emperor's
being
expected
to
arrive
next
day--all
aroused
with
fresh
force
that
feeling
of
agitation
and
expectation
in
Pierre
which
he
had
been
conscious
of
ever
since
the
appearance
of
the
comet,
and
especially
since
the
beginning
of
the
war.
He
had
long
been
thinking
of
entering
the
army
and
would
have
done
so
had
he
not
been
hindered,
first,
by
his
membership
of
the
Society
of
Freemasons
to
which
he
was
bound
by
oath
and
which
preached
perpetual
peace
and
the
abolition
of
war,
and
secondly,
by
the
fact
that
when
he
saw
the
great
mass
of
Muscovites
who
had
donned
uniform
and
were
talking
patriotism,
he
somehow
felt
ashamed
to
take
the
step.
But
the
chief
reason
for
not
carrying
out
his
intention
to
enter
the
army
lay
in
the
vague
idea
that
he
was
L'russe
Besuhof
who
had
the
number
of
the
beast,
666;
that
his
part
in
the
great
affair
of
setting
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
beast
that
spoke
great
and
blasphemous
things
had
been
predestined
from
eternity,
and
that
therefore
he
ought
not
to
undertake
anything,
but
wait
for
what
was
bound
to
come
to
pass.
CHAPTER
XX
A
few
intimate
friends
were
dining
with
the
Rostovs
that
day,
as
usual
on
Sundays.
Pierre
came
early
so
as
to
find
them
alone.
He
had
grown
so
stout
this
year
that
he
would
have
been
abnormal
had
he
not
been
so
tall,
so
broad
of
limb,
and
so
strong
that
he
carried
his
bulk
with
evident
ease.
He
went
up
the
stairs,
puffing
and
muttering
something.
His
coachman
did
not
even
ask
whether
he
was
to
wait.
He
knew
that
when
his
master
was
at
the
Rostovs'
he
stayed
till
midnight.
The
Rostovs'
footman
rushed
eagerly
forward
to
help
him
off
with
his
cloak
and
take
his
hat
and
stick.
Pierre,
from
club
habit,
always
left
both
hat
and
stick
in
the
anteroom.
The
first
person
he
saw
in
the
house
was
Natasha.
Even
before
he
saw
her,
while
taking
off
his
cloak,
he
heard
her.
She
was
practicing
solfa
exercises
in
the
music
room.
He
knew
that
she
had
not
sung
since
her
illness,
and
so
the
sound
of
her
voice
surprised
and
delighted
him.
He
opened
the
door
softly
and
saw
her,
in
the
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
at
church,
walking
about
the
room
singing.
She
had
her
back
to
him
when
he
opened
the
door,
but
when,
turning
quickly,
she
saw
his
broad,
surprised
face,
she
blushed
and
came
rapidly
up
to
him.
"I
want
to
try
to
sing
again,"
she
said,
adding
as
if
by
way
of
excuse,
"it
is,
at
least,
something
to
do."
"That's
capital!"
"How
glad
I
am
you've
come!
I
am
so
happy
today,"
she
said,
with
the
old
animation
Pierre
had
not
seen
in
her
for
a
long
time.
"You
know
Nicholas
has
received
a
St.
George's
Cross?
I
am
so
proud
of
him."
"Oh
yes,
I
sent
that
announcement.
But
I
don't
want
to
interrupt
you,"
he
added,
and
was
about
to
go
to
the
drawing
room.
Natasha
stopped
him.
"Count,
is
it
wrong
of
me
to
sing?"
she
said
blushing,
and
fixing
her
eyes
inquiringly
on
him.
"No...
Why
should
it
be?
On
the
contrary...
But
why
do
you
ask
me?"
"I
don't
know
myself,"
Natasha
answered
quickly,
"but
I
should
not
like
to
do
anything
you
disapproved
of.
I
believe
in
you
completely.
You
don't
know
how
important
you
are
to
me,
how
much
you've
done
for
me...."
She
spoke
rapidly
and
did
not
notice
how
Pierre
flushed
at
her
words.
"I
saw
in
that
same
army
order
that
he,
Bolkonski"
(she
whispered
the
name
hastily),
"is
in
Russia,
and
in
the
army
again.
What
do
you
think?"--she
was
speaking
hurriedly,
evidently
afraid
her
strength
might
fail
her--
"Will
he
ever
forgive
me?
Will
he
not
always
have
a
bitter
feeling
toward
me?
What
do
you
think?
What
do
you
think?"
"I
think..."
Pierre
replied,
"that
he
has
nothing
to
forgive....
If
I
were
in
his
place..."
By
association
of
ideas,
Pierre
was
at
once
carried
back
to
the
day
when,
trying
to
comfort
her,
he
had
said
that
if
he
were
not
himself
but
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
free,
he
would
ask
on
his
knees
for
her
hand;
and
the
same
feeling
of
pity,
tenderness,
and
love
took
possession
of
him
and
the
same
words
rose
to
his
lips.
But
she
did
not
give
him
time
to
say
them.
"Yes,
you...
you..."
she
said,
uttering
the
word
you
rapturously--
"that's
a
different
thing.
I
know
no
one
kinder,
more
generous,
or
better
than
you;
nobody
could
be!
Had
you
not
been
there
then,
and
now
too,
I
don't
know
what
would
have
become
of
me,
because..."
Tears
suddenly
rose
in
her
eyes,
she
turned
away,
lifted
her
music
before
her
eyes,
began
singing
again,
and
again
began
walking
up
and
down
the
room.
Just
then
Petya
came
running
in
from
the
drawing
room.
Petya
was
now
a
handsome
rosy
lad
of
fifteen
with
full
red
lips
and
resembled
Natasha.
He
was
preparing
to
enter
the
university,
but
he
and
his
friend
Obolenski
had
lately,
in
secret,
agreed
to
join
the
hussars.
Petya
had
come
rushing
out
to
talk
to
his
namesake
about
this
affair.
He
had
asked
Pierre
to
find
out
whether
he
would
be
accepted
in
the
hussars.
Pierre
walked
up
and
down
the
drawing
room,
not
listening
to
what
Petya
was
saying.
Petya
pulled
him
by
the
arm
to
attract
his
attention.
"Well,
what
about
my
plan?
Peter
Kirilych,
for
heaven's
sake!
You
are
my
only
hope,"
said
Petya.
"Oh
yes,
your
plan.
To
join
the
hussars?
I'll
mention
it,
I'll
bring
it
all
up
today."
"Well,
mon
cher,
have
you
got
the
manifesto?"
asked
the
old
count.
"The
countess
has
been
to
Mass
at
the
Razumovskis'
and
heard
the
new
prayer.
She
says
it's
very
fine."
"Yes,
I've
got
it,"
said
Pierre.
"The
Emperor
is
to
be
here
tomorrow...
there's
to
be
an
Extraordinary
Meeting
of
the
nobility,
and
they
are
talking
of
a
levy
of
ten
men
per
thousand.
Oh
yes,
let
me
congratulate
you!"
"Yes,
yes,
thank
God!
Well,
and
what
news
from
the
army?"
"We
are
again
retreating.
They
say
we're
already
near
Smolensk,"
replied
Pierre.
"O
Lord,
O
Lord!"
exclaimed
the
count.
"Where
is
the
manifesto?"
"The
Emperor's
appeal?
Oh
yes!"
Pierre
began
feeling
in
his
pockets
for
the
papers,
but
could
not
find
them.
Still
slapping
his
pockets,
he
kissed
the
hand
of
the
countess
who
entered
the
room
and
glanced
uneasily
around,
evidently
expecting
Natasha,
who
had
left
off
singing
but
had
not
yet
come
into
the
drawing
room.
"On
my
word,
I
don't
know
what
I've
done
with
it,"
he
said.
"There
he
is,
always
losing
everything!"
remarked
the
countess.
Natasha
entered
with
a
softened
and
agitated
expression
of
face
and
sat
down
looking
silently
at
Pierre.
As
soon
as
she
entered,
Pierre's
features,
which
had
been
gloomy,
suddenly
lighted
up,
and
while
still
searching
for
the
papers
he
glanced
at
her
several
times.
"No,
really!
I'll
drive
home,
I
must
have
left
them
there.
I'll
certainly..."
"But
you'll
be
late
for
dinner."
"Oh!
And
my
coachman
has
gone."
But
Sonya,
who
had
gone
to
look
for
the
papers
in
the
anteroom,
had
found
them
in
Pierre's
hat,
where
he
had
carefully
tucked
them
under
the
lining.
Pierre
was
about
to
begin
reading.
"No,
after
dinner,"
said
the
old
count,
evidently
expecting
much
enjoyment
from
that
reading.
At
dinner,
at
which
champagne
was
drunk
to
the
health
of
the
new
chevalier
of
St.
George,
Shinshin
told
them
the
town
news,
of
the
illness
of
the
old
Georgian
princess,
of
Metivier's
disappearance
from
Moscow,
and
of
how
some
German
fellow
had
been
brought
to
Rostopchin
and
accused
of
being
a
French
"spyer"
(so
Count
Rostopchin
had
told
the
story),
and
how
Rostopchin
let
him
go
and
assured
the
people
that
he
was
"not
a
spire
at
all,
but
only
an
old
German
ruin."
"People
are
being
arrested..."
said
the
count.
"I've
told
the
countess
she
should
not
speak
French
so
much.
It's
not
the
time
for
it
now."
"And
have
you
heard?"
Shinshin
asked.
"Prince
Golitsyn
has
engaged
a
master
to
teach
him
Russian.
It
is
becoming
dangerous
to
speak
French
in
the
streets."
"And
how
about
you,
Count
Peter
Kirilych?
If
they
call
up
the
militia,
you
too
will
have
to
mount
a
horse,"
remarked
the
old
count,
addressing
Pierre.
Pierre
had
been
silent
and
preoccupied
all
through
dinner,
seeming
not
to
grasp
what
was
said.
He
looked
at
the
count.
"Oh
yes,
the
war,"
he
said.
"No!
What
sort
of
warrior
should
I
make?
And
yet
everything
is
so
strange,
so
strange!
I
can't
make
it
out.
I
don't
know,
I
am
very
far
from
having
military
tastes,
but
in
these
times
no
one
can
answer
for
himself."
After
dinner
the
count
settled
himself
comfortably
in
an
easy
chair
and
with
a
serious
face
asked
Sonya,
who
was
considered
an
excellent
reader,
to
read
the
appeal.
"To
Moscow,
our
ancient
Capital!
"The
enemy
has
entered
the
borders
of
Russia
with
immense
forces.
He
comes
to
despoil
our
beloved
country."
Sonya
read
painstakingly
in
her
high-pitched
voice.
The
count
listened
with
closed
eyes,
heaving
abrupt
sighs
at
certain
passages.
Natasha
sat
erect,
gazing
with
a
searching
look
now
at
her
father
and
now
at
Pierre.
Pierre
felt
her
eyes
on
him
and
tried
not
to
look
round.
The
countess
shook
her
head
disapprovingly
and
angrily
at
every
solemn
expression
in
the
manifesto.
In
all
these
words
she
saw
only
that
the
danger
threatening
her
son
would
not
soon
be
over.
Shinshin,
with
a
sarcastic
smile
on
his
lips,
was
evidently
preparing
to
make
fun
of
anything
that
gave
him
the
opportunity:
Sonya's
reading,
any
remark
of
the
count's,
or
even
the
manifesto
itself
should
no
better
pretext
present
itself.
After
reading
about
the
dangers
that
threatened
Russia,
the
hopes
the
Emperor
placed
on
Moscow
and
especially
on
its
illustrious
nobility,
Sonya,
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
due
chiefly
to
the
attention
that
was
being
paid
to
her,
read
the
last
words:
"We
ourselves
will
not
delay
to
appear
among
our
people
in
that
Capital
and
in
other
parts
of
our
realm
for
consultation,
and
for
the
direction
of
all
our
levies,
both
those
now
barring
the
enemy's
path
and
those
freshly
formed
to
defeat
him
wherever
he
may
appear.
May
the
ruin
he
hopes
to
bring
upon
us
recoil
on
his
own
head,
and
may
Europe
delivered
from
bondage
glorify
the
name
of
Russia!"
"Yes,
that's
it!"
cried
the
count,
opening
his
moist
eyes
and
sniffing
repeatedly,
as
if
a
strong
vinaigrette
had
been
held
to
his
nose;
and
he
added,
"Let
the
Emperor
but
say
the
word
and
we'll
sacrifice
everything
and
begrudge
nothing."
Before
Shinshin
had
time
to
utter
the
joke
he
was
ready
to
make
on
the
count's
patriotism,
Natasha
jumped
up
from
her
place
and
ran
to
her
father.
"What
a
darling
our
Papa
is!"
she
cried,
kissing
him,
and
she
again
looked
at
Pierre
with
the
unconscious
coquetry
that
had
returned
to
her
with
her
better
spirits.
"There!
Here's
a
patriot
for
you!"
said
Shinshin.
"Not
a
patriot
at
all,
but
simply..."
Natasha
replied
in
an
injured
tone.
"Everything
seems
funny
to
you,
but
this
isn't
at
all
a
joke...."
"A
joke
indeed!"
put
in
the
count.
"Let
him
but
say
the
word
and
we'll
all
go....
We're
not
Germans!"
"But
did
you
notice,
it
says,
'for
consultation'?"
said
Pierre.
"Never
mind
what
it's
for...."
At
this
moment,
Petya,
to
whom
nobody
was
paying
any
attention,
came
up
to
his
father
with
a
very
flushed
face
and
said
in
his
breaking
voice
that
was
now
deep
and
now
shrill:
"Well,
Papa,
I
tell
you
definitely,
and
Mamma
too,
it's
as
you
please,
but
I
say
definitely
that
you
must
let
me
enter
the
army,
because
I
can't...
that's
all...."
The
countess,
in
dismay,
looked
up
to
heaven,
clasped
her
hands,
and
turned
angrily
to
her
husband.
"That
comes
of
your
talking!"
said
she.
But
the
count
had
already
recovered
from
his
excitement.
"Come,
come!"
said
he.
"Here's
a
fine
warrior!
No!
Nonsense!
You
must
study."
"It's
not
nonsense,
Papa.
Fedya
Obolenski
is
younger
than
I,
and
he's
going
too.
Besides,
all
the
same
I
can't
study
now
when..."
Petya
stopped
short,
flushed
till
he
perspired,
but
still
got
out
the
words,
"when
our
Fatherland
is
in
danger."
"That'll
do,
that'll
do--nonsense...."
"But
you
said
yourself
that
we
would
sacrifice
everything."
"Petya!
Be
quiet,
I
tell
you!"
cried
the
count,
with
a
glance
at
his
wife,
who
had
turned
pale
and
was
staring
fixedly
at
her
son.
"And
I
tell
you--Peter
Kirilych
here
will
also
tell
you..."
"Nonsense,
I
tell
you.
Your
mother's
milk
has
hardly
dried
on
your
lips
and
you
want
to
go
into
the
army!
There,
there,
I
tell
you,"
and
the
count
moved
to
go
out
of
the
room,
taking
the
papers,
probably
to
reread
them
in
his
study
before
having
a
nap.
"Well,
Peter
Kirilych,
let's
go
and
have
a
smoke,"
he
said.
Pierre
was
agitated
and
undecided.
Natasha's
unwontedly
brilliant
eyes,
continually
glancing
at
him
with
a
more
than
cordial
look,
had
reduced
him
to
this
condition.
"No,
I
think
I'll
go
home."
"Home?
Why,
you
meant
to
spend
the
evening
with
us....
You
don't
often
come
nowadays
as
it
is,
and
this
girl
of
mine,"
said
the
count
good-
naturedly,
pointing
to
Natasha,
"only
brightens
up
when
you're
here."
"Yes,
I
had
forgotten...
I
really
must
go
home...
business..."
said
Pierre
hurriedly.
"Well,
then,
au
revoir!"
said
the
count,
and
went
out
of
the
room.
"Why
are
you
going?
Why
are
you
upset?"
asked
Natasha,
and
she
looked
challengingly
into
Pierre's
eyes.
"Because
I
love
you!"
was
what
he
wanted
to
say,
but
he
did
not
say
it,
and
only
blushed
till
the
tears
came,
and
lowered
his
eyes.
"Because
it
is
better
for
me
to
come
less
often...
because...
No,
simply
I
have
business...."
"Why?
No,
tell
me!"
Natasha
began
resolutely
and
suddenly
stopped.
They
looked
at
each
other
with
dismayed
and
embarrassed
faces.
He
tried
to
smile
but
could
not:
his
smile
expressed
suffering,
and
he
silently
kissed
her
hand
and
went
out.
Pierre
made
up
his
mind
not
to
go
to
the
Rostovs'
any
more.
CHAPTER
XXI
After
the
definite
refusal
he
had
received,
Petya
went
to
his
room
and
there
locked
himself
in
and
wept
bitterly.
When
he
came
in
to
tea,
silent,
morose,
and
with
tear-stained
face,
everybody
pretended
not
to
notice
anything.
Next
day
the
Emperor
arrived
in
Moscow,
and
several
of
the
Rostovs'
domestic
serfs
begged
permission
to
go
to
have
a
look
at
him.
That
morning
Petya
was
a
long
time
dressing
and
arranging
his
hair
and
collar
to
look
like
a
grown-up
man.
He
frowned
before
his
looking
glass,
gesticulated,
shrugged
his
shoulders,
and
finally,
without
saying
a
word
to
anyone,
took
his
cap
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door,
trying
to
avoid
notice.
Petya
decided
to
go
straight
to
where
the
Emperor
was
and
to
explain
frankly
to
some
gentleman-in-waiting
(he
imagined
the
Emperor
to
be
always
surrounded
by
gentlemen-in-waiting)
that
he,
Count
Rostov,
in
spite
of
his
youth
wished
to
serve
his
country;
that
youth
could
be
no
hindrance
to
loyalty,
and
that
he
was
ready
to...
While
dressing,
Petya
had
prepared
many
fine
things
he
meant
to
say
to
the
gentleman-in-
waiting.
It
was
on
the
very
fact
of
being
so
young
that
Petya
counted
for
success
in
reaching
the
Emperor--he
even
thought
how
surprised
everyone
would
be
at
his
youthfulness--and
yet
in
the
arrangement
of
his
collar
and
hair
and
by
his
sedate
deliberate
walk
he
wished
to
appear
a
grown-up
man.
But
the
farther
he
went
and
the
more
his
attention
was
diverted
by
the
ever-increasing
crowds
moving
toward
the
Kremlin,
the
less
he
remembered
to
walk
with
the
sedateness
and
deliberation
of
a
man.
As
he
approached
the
Kremlin
he
even
began
to
avoid
being
crushed
and
resolutely
stuck
out
his
elbows
in
a
menacing
way.
But
within
the
Trinity
Gateway
he
was
so
pressed
to
the
wall
by
people
who
probably
were
unaware
of
the
patriotic
intentions
with
which
he
had
come
that
in
spite
of
all
his
determination
he
had
to
give
in,
and
stop
while
carriages
passed
in,
rumbling
beneath
the
archway.
Beside
Petya
stood
a
peasant
woman,
a
footman,
two
tradesmen,
and
a
discharged
soldier.
After
standing
some
time
in
the
gateway,
Petya
tried
to
move
forward
in
front
of
the
others
without
waiting
for
all
the
carriages
to
pass,
and
he
began
resolutely
working
his
way
with
his
elbows,
but
the
woman
just
in
front
of
him,
who
was
the
first
against
whom
he
directed
his
efforts,
angrily
shouted
at
him:
"What
are
you
shoving
for,
young
lordling?
Don't
you
see
we're
all
standing
still?
Then
why
push?"
"Anybody
can
shove,"
said
the
footman,
and
also
began
working
his
elbows
to
such
effect
that
he
pushed
Petya
into
a
very
filthy
corner
of
the
gateway.
Petya
wiped
his
perspiring
face
with
his
hands
and
pulled
up
the
damp
collar
which
he
had
arranged
so
well
at
home
to
seem
like
a
man's.
He
felt
that
he
no
longer
looked
presentable,
and
feared
that
if
he
were
now
to
approach
the
gentlemen-in-waiting
in
that
plight
he
would
not
be
admitted
to
the
Emperor.
But
it
was
impossible
to
smarten
oneself
up
or
move
to
another
place,
because
of
the
crowd.
One
of
the
generals
who
drove
past
was
an
acquaintance
of
the
Rostovs',
and
Petya
thought
of
asking
his
help,
but
came
to
the
conclusion
that
that
would
not
be
a
manly
thing
to
do.
When
the
carriages
had
all
passed
in,
the
crowd,
carrying
Petya
with
it,
streamed
forward
into
the
Kremlin
Square
which
was
already
full
of
people.
There
were
people
not
only
in
the
square,
but
everywhere--on
the
slopes
and
on
the
roofs.
As
soon
as
Petya
found
himself
in
the
square
he
clearly
heard
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
joyous
voices
of
the
crowd
that
filled
the
whole
Kremlin.
For
a
while
the
crowd
was
less
dense,
but
suddenly
all
heads
were
bared,
and
everyone
rushed
forward
in
one
direction.
Petya
was
being
pressed
so
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe,
and
everybody
shouted,
"Hurrah!
hurrah!
hurrah!"
Petya
stood
on
tiptoe
and
pushed
and
pinched,
but
could
see
nothing
except
the
people
about
him.
All
the
faces
bore
the
same
expression
of
excitement
and
enthusiasm.
A
tradesman's
wife
standing
beside
Petya
sobbed,
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks.
"Father!
Angel!
Dear
one!"
she
kept
repeating,
wiping
away
her
tears
with
her
fingers.
"Hurrah!"
was
heard
on
all
sides.
For
a
moment
the
crowd
stood
still,
but
then
it
made
another
rush
forward.
Quite
beside
himself,
Petya,
clinching
his
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
ferociously,
pushed
forward,
elbowing
his
way
and
shouting
"hurrah!"
as
if
he
were
prepared
that
instant
to
kill
himself
and
everyone
else,
but
on
both
sides
of
him
other
people
with
similarly
ferocious
faces
pushed
forward
and
everybody
shouted
"hurrah!"
"So
this
is
what
the
Emperor
is!"
thought
Petya.
"No,
I
can't
petition
him
myself--that
would
be
too
bold."
But
in
spite
of
this
he
continued
to
struggle
desperately
forward,
and
from
between
the
backs
of
those
in
front
he
caught
glimpses
of
an
open
space
with
a
strip
of
red
cloth
spread
out
on
it;
but
just
then
the
crowd
swayed
back--the
police
in
front
were
pushing
back
those
who
had
pressed
too
close
to
the
procession:
the
Emperor
was
passing
from
the
palace
to
the
Cathedral
of
the
Assumption--and
Petya
unexpectedly
received
such
a
blow
on
his
side
and
ribs
and
was
squeezed
so
hard
that
suddenly
everything
grew
dim
before
his
eyes
and
he
lost
consciousness.
When
he
came
to
himself,
a
man
of
clerical
appearance
with
a
tuft
of
gray
hair
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
wearing
a
shabby
blue
cassock--probably
a
church
clerk
and
chanter--was
holding
him
under
the
arm
with
one
hand
while
warding
off
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
with
the
other.
"You've
crushed
the
young
gentleman!"
said
the
clerk.
"What
are
you
up
to?
Gently!...
They've
crushed
him,
crushed
him!"
The
Emperor
entered
the
Cathedral
of
the
Assumption.
The
crowd
spread
out
again
more
evenly,
and
the
clerk
led
Petya--pale
and
breathless--to
the
Tsar-cannon.
Several
people
were
sorry
for
Petya,
and
suddenly
a
crowd
turned
toward
him
and
pressed
round
him.
Those
who
stood
nearest
him
attended
to
him,
unbuttoned
his
coat,
seated
him
on
the
raised
platform
of
the
cannon,
and
reproached
those
others
(whoever
they
might
be)
who
had
crushed
him.
"One
might
easily
get
killed
that
way!
What
do
they
mean
by
it?
Killing
people!
Poor
dear,
he's
as
white
as
a
sheet!"--various
voices
were
heard
saying.
Petya
soon
came
to
himself,
the
color
returned
to
his
face,
the
pain
had
passed,
and
at
the
cost
of
that
temporary
unpleasantness
he
had
obtained
a
place
by
the
cannon
from
where
he
hoped
to
see
the
Emperor
who
would
be
returning
that
way.
Petya
no
longer
thought
of
presenting
his
petition.
If
he
could
only
see
the
Emperor
he
would
be
happy!
While
the
service
was
proceeding
in
the
Cathedral
of
the
Assumption--it
was
a
combined
service
of
prayer
on
the
occasion
of
the
Emperor's
arrival
and
of
thanksgiving
for
the
conclusion
of
peace
with
the
Turks--
the
crowd
outside
spread
out
and
hawkers
appeared,
selling
kvas,
gingerbread,
and
poppyseed
sweets
(of
which
Petya
was
particularly
fond),
and
ordinary
conversation
could
again
be
heard.
A
tradesman's
wife
was
showing
a
rent
in
her
shawl
and
telling
how
much
the
shawl
had
cost;
another
was
saying
that
all
silk
goods
had
now
got
dear.
The
clerk
who
had
rescued
Petya
was
talking
to
a
functionary
about
the
priests
who
were
officiating
that
day
with
the
bishop.
The
clerk
several
times
used
the
word
"plenary"
(of
the
service),
a
word
Petya
did
not
understand.
Two
young
citizens
were
joking
with
some
serf
girls
who
were
cracking
nuts.
All
these
conversations,
especially
the
joking
with
the
girls,
were
such
as
might
have
had
a
particular
charm
for
Petya
at
his
age,
but
they
did
not
interest
him
now.
He
sat
on
his
elevation--the
pedestal
of
the
cannon--still
agitated
as
before
by
the
thought
of
the
Emperor
and
by
his
love
for
him.
The
feeling
of
pain
and
fear
he
had
experienced
when
he
was
being
crushed,
together
with
that
of
rapture,
still
further
intensified
his
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion.
Suddenly
the
sound
of
a
firing
of
cannon
was
heard
from
the
embankment,
to
celebrate
the
signing
of
peace
with
the
Turks,
and
the
crowd
rushed
impetuously
toward
the
embankment
to
watch
the
firing.
Petya
too
would
have
run
there,
but
the
clerk
who
had
taken
the
young
gentleman
under
his
protection
stopped
him.
The
firing
was
still
proceeding
when
officers,
generals,
and
gentlemen-in-waiting
came
running
out
of
the
cathedral,
and
after
them
others
in
a
more
leisurely
manner:
caps
were
again
raised,
and
those
who
had
run
to
look
at
the
cannon
ran
back
again.
At
last
four
men
in
uniforms
and
sashes
emerged
from
the
cathedral
doors.
"Hurrah!
hurrah!"
shouted
the
crowd
again.
"Which
is
he?
Which?"
asked
Petya
in
a
tearful
voice,
of
those
around
him,
but
no
one
answered
him,
everybody
was
too
excited;
and
Petya,
fixing
on
one
of
those
four
men,
whom
he
could
not
clearly
see
for
the
tears
of
joy
that
filled
his
eyes,
concentrated
all
his
enthusiasm
on
him--though
it
happened
not
to
be
the
Emperor--frantically
shouted
"Hurrah!"
and
resolved
that
tomorrow,
come
what
might,
he
would
join
the
army.
The
crowd
ran
after
the
Emperor,
followed
him
to
the
palace,
and
began
to
disperse.
It
was
already
late,
and
Petya
had
not
eaten
anything
and
was
drenched
with
perspiration,
yet
he
did
not
go
home
but
stood
with
that
diminishing,
but
still
considerable,
crowd
before
the
palace
while
the
Emperor
dined--looking
in
at
the
palace
windows,
expecting
he
knew
not
what,
and
envying
alike
the
notables
he
saw
arriving
at
the
entrance
to
dine
with
the
Emperor
and
the
court
footmen
who
served
at
table,
glimpses
of
whom
could
be
seen
through
the
windows.
While
the
Emperor
was
dining,
Valuev,
looking
out
of
the
window,
said:
"The
people
are
still
hoping
to
see
Your
Majesty
again."
The
dinner
was
nearly
over,
and
the
Emperor,
munching
a
biscuit,
rose
and
went
out
onto
the
balcony.
The
people,
with
Petya
among
them,
rushed
toward
the
balcony.
"Angel!
Dear
one!
Hurrah!
Father!..."
cried
the
crowd,
and
Petya
with
it,
and
again
the
women
and
men
of
weaker
mold,
Petya
among
them,
wept
with
joy.
A
largish
piece
of
the
biscuit
the
Emperor
was
holding
in
his
hand
broke
off,
fell
on
the
balcony
parapet,
and
then
to
the
ground.
A
coachman
in
a
jerkin,
who
stood
nearest,
sprang
forward
and
snatched
it
up.
Several
people
in
the
crowd
rushed
at
the
coachman.
Seeing
this
the
Emperor
had
a
plateful
of
biscuits
brought
him
and
began
throwing
them
down
from
the
balcony.
Petya's
eyes
grew
bloodshot,
and
still
more
excited
by
the
danger
of
being
crushed,
he
rushed
at
the
biscuits.
He
did
not
know
why,
but
he
had
to
have
a
biscuit
from
the
Tsar's
hand
and
he
felt
that
he
must
not
give
way.
He
sprang
forward
and
upset
an
old
woman
who
was
catching
at
a
biscuit;
the
old
woman
did
not
consider
herself
defeated
though
she
was
lying
on
the
ground--she
grabbed
at
some
biscuits
but
her
hand
did
not
reach
them.
Petya
pushed
her
hand
away
with
his
knee,
seized
a
biscuit,
and
as
if
fearing
to
be
too
late,
again
shouted
"Hurrah!"
with
a
voice
already
hoarse.
The
Emperor
went
in,
and
after
that
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
began
to
disperse.
"There!
I
said
if
only
we
waited--and
so
it
was!"
was
being
joyfully
said
by
various
people.
Happy
as
Petya
was,
he
felt
sad
at
having
to
go
home
knowing
that
all
the
enjoyment
of
that
day
was
over.
He
did
not
go
straight
home
from
the
Kremlin,
but
called
on
his
friend
Obolenski,
who
was
fifteen
and
was
also
entering
the
regiment.
On
returning
home
Petya
announced
resolutely
and
firmly
that
if
he
was
not
allowed
to
enter
the
service
he
would
run
away.
And
next
day,
Count
Ilya
Rostov--though
he
had
not
yet
quite
yielded--went
to
inquire
how
he
could
arrange
for
Petya
to
serve
where
there
would
be
least
danger.
CHAPTER
XXII
Two
days
later,
on
the
fifteenth
of
July,
an
immense
number
of
carriages
were
standing
outside
the
Sloboda
Palace.
The
great
halls
were
full.
In
the
first
were
the
nobility
and
gentry
in
their
uniforms,
in
the
second
bearded
merchants
in
full-skirted
coats
of
blue
cloth
and
wearing
medals.
In
the
noblemen's
hall
there
was
an
incessant
movement
and
buzz
of
voices.
The
chief
magnates
sat
on
high-
backed
chairs
at
a
large
table
under
the
portrait
of
the
Emperor,
but
most
of
the
gentry
were
strolling
about
the
room.
All
these
nobles,
whom
Pierre
met
every
day
at
the
club
or
in
their
own
houses,
were
in
uniform--some
in
that
of
Catherine's
day,
others
in
that
of
Emperor
Paul,
others
again
in
the
new
uniforms
of
Alexander's
time
or
the
ordinary
uniform
of
the
nobility,
and
the
general
characteristic
of
being
in
uniform
imparted
something
strange
and
fantastic
to
these
diverse
and
familiar
personalities,
both
old
and
young.
The
old
men,
dim-eyed,
toothless,
bald,
sallow,
and
bloated,
or
gaunt
and
wrinkled,
were
especially
striking.
For
the
most
part
they
sat
quietly
in
their
places
and
were
silent,
or,
if
they
walked
about
and
talked,
attached
themselves
to
someone
younger.
On
all
these
faces,
as
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
Petya
had
seen
in
the
Square,
there
was
a
striking
contradiction:
the
general
expectation
of
a
solemn
event,
and
at
the
same
time
the
everyday
interests
in
a
boston
card
party,
Peter
the
cook,
Zinaida
Dmitrievna's
health,
and
so
on.
Pierre
was
there
too,
buttoned
up
since
early
morning
in
a
nobleman's
uniform
that
had
become
too
tight
for
him.
He
was
agitated;
this
extraordinary
gathering
not
only
of
nobles
but
also
of
the
merchant-
class--les
etats
generaux
(States-General)--evoked
in
him
a
whole
series
of
ideas
he
had
long
laid
aside
but
which
were
deeply
graven
in
his
soul:
thoughts
of
the
Contrat
Social
and
the
French
Revolution.
The
words
that
had
struck
him
in
the
Emperor's
appeal--that
the
sovereign
was
coming
to
the
capital
for
consultation
with
his
people--strengthened
this
idea.
And
imagining
that
in
this
direction
something
important
which
he
had
long
awaited
was
drawing
near,
he
strolled
about
watching
and
listening
to
conversations,
but
nowhere
finding
any
confirmation
of
the
ideas
that
occupied
him.
The
Emperor's
manifesto
was
read,
evoking
enthusiasm,
and
then
all
moved
about
discussing
it.
Besides
the
ordinary
topics
of
conversation,
Pierre
heard
questions
of
where
the
marshals
of
the
nobility
were
to
stand
when
the
Emperor
entered,
when
a
ball
should
be
given
in
the
Emperor's
honor,
whether
they
should
group
themselves
by
districts
or
by
whole
provinces...
and
so
on;
but
as
soon
as
the
war
was
touched
on,
or
what
the
nobility
had
been
convened
for,
the
talk
became
undecided
and
indefinite.
Then
all
preferred
listening
to
speaking.
A
middle-aged
man,
handsome
and
virile,
in
the
uniform
of
a
retired
naval
officer,
was
speaking
in
one
of
the
rooms,
and
a
small
crowd
was
pressing
round
him.
Pierre
went
up
to
the
circle
that
had
formed
round
the
speaker
and
listened.
Count
Ilya
Rostov,
in
a
military
uniform
of
Catherine's
time,
was
sauntering
with
a
pleasant
smile
among
the
crowd,
with
all
of
whom
he
was
acquainted.
He
too
approached
that
group
and
listened
with
a
kindly
smile
and
nods
of
approval,
as
he
always
did,
to
what
the
speaker
was
saying.
The
retired
naval
man
was
speaking
very
boldly,
as
was
evident
from
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
listeners
and
from
the
fact
that
some
people
Pierre
knew
as
the
meekest
and
quietest
of
men
walked
away
disapprovingly
or
expressed
disagreement
with
him.
Pierre
pushed
his
way
into
the
middle
of
the
group,
listened,
and
convinced
himself
that
the
man
was
indeed
a
liberal,
but
of
views
quite
different
from
his
own.
The
naval
officer
spoke
in
a
particularly
sonorous,
musical,
and
aristocratic
baritone
voice,
pleasantly
swallowing
his
r's
and
generally
slurring
his
consonants:
the
voice
of
a
man
calling
out
to
his
servant,
"Heah!
Bwing
me
my
pipe!"
It
was
indicative
of
dissipation
and
the
exercise
of
authority.
"What
if
the
Smolensk
people
have
offahd
to
waise
militia
for
the
Empewah?
Ah
we
to
take
Smolensk
as
our
patte'n?
If
the
noble
awistocwacy
of
the
pwovince
of
Moscow
thinks
fit,
it
can
show
its
loyalty
to
our
sov'weign
the
Empewah
in
other
ways.
Have
we
fo'gotten
the
waising
of
the
militia
in
the
yeah
'seven?
All
that
did
was
to
enwich
the
pwiests'
sons
and
thieves
and
wobbahs...."
Count
Ilya
Rostov
smiled
blandly
and
nodded
approval.
"And
was
our
militia
of
any
use
to
the
Empia?
Not
at
all!
It
only
wuined
our
farming!
Bettah
have
another
conscwiption...
o'
ou'
men
will
wetu'n
neithah
soldiers
no'
peasants,
and
we'll
get
only
depwavity
fwom
them.
The
nobility
don't
gwudge
theah
lives--evewy
one
of
us
will
go
and
bwing
in
more
wecwuits,
and
the
sov'weign"
(that
was
the
way
he
referred
to
the
Emperor)
"need
only
say
the
word
and
we'll
all
die
fo'
him!"
added
the
orator
with
animation.
Count
Rostov's
mouth
watered
with
pleasure
and
he
nudged
Pierre,
but
Pierre
wanted
to
speak
himself.
He
pushed
forward,
feeling
stirred,
but
not
yet
sure
what
stirred
him
or
what
he
would
say.
Scarcely
had
he
opened
his
mouth
when
one
of
the
senators,
a
man
without
a
tooth
in
his
head,
with
a
shrewd
though
angry
expression,
standing
near
the
first
speaker,
interrupted
him.
Evidently
accustomed
to
managing
debates
and
to
maintaining
an
argument,
he
began
in
low
but
distinct
tones:
"I
imagine,
sir,"
said
he,
mumbling
with
his
toothless
mouth,
"that
we
have
been
summoned
here
not
to
discuss
whether
it's
best
for
the
empire
at
the
present
moment
to
adopt
conscription
or
to
call
out
the
militia.
We
have
been
summoned
to
reply
to
the
appeal
with
which
our
sovereign
the
Emperor
has
honored
us.
But
to
judge
what
is
best--conscription
or
the
militia--we
can
leave
to
the
supreme
authority...."
Pierre
suddenly
saw
an
outlet
for
his
excitement.
He
hardened
his
heart
against
the
senator
who
was
introducing
this
set
and
narrow
attitude
into
the
deliberations
of
the
nobility.
Pierre
stepped
forward
and
interrupted
him.
He
himself
did
not
yet
know
what
he
would
say,
but
he
began
to
speak
eagerly,
occasionally
lapsing
into
French
or
expressing
himself
in
bookish
Russian.
"Excuse
me,
your
excellency,"
he
began.
(He
was
well
acquainted
with
the
senator,
but
thought
it
necessary
on
this
occasion
to
address
him
formally.)
"Though
I
don't
agree
with
the
gentleman..."
(he
hesitated:
he
wished
to
say,
"Mon
tres
honorable
preopinant"--"My
very
honorable
opponent")
"with
the
gentleman...
whom
I
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing,
I
suppose
that
the
nobility
have
been
summoned
not
merely
to
express
their
sympathy
and
enthusiasm
but
also
to
consider
the
means
by
which
we
can
assist
our
Fatherland!
I
imagine,"
he
went
on,
warming
to
his
subject,
"that
the
Emperor
himself
would
not
be
satisfied
to
find
in
us
merely
owners
of
serfs
whom
we
are
willing
to
devote
to
his
service,
and
chair
a
canon
*
we
are
ready
to
make
of
ourselves--and
not
to
obtain
from
us
any
co-co-counsel."
*
"Food
for
cannon."
Many
persons
withdrew
from
the
circle,
noticing
the
senator's
sarcastic
smile
and
the
freedom
of
Pierre's
remarks.
Only
Count
Rostov
was
pleased
with
them
as
he
had
been
pleased
with
those
of
the
naval
officer,
the
senator,
and
in
general
with
whatever
speech
he
had
last
heard.
"I
think
that
before
discussing
these
questions,"
Pierre
continued,
"we
should
ask
the
Emperor--most
respectfully
ask
His
Majesty--to
let
us
know
the
number
of
our
troops
and
the
position
in
which
our
army
and
our
forces
now
are,
and
then..."
But
scarcely
had
Pierre
uttered
these
words
before
he
was
attacked
from
three
sides.
The
most
vigorous
attack
came
from
an
old
acquaintance,
a
boston
player
who
had
always
been
well
disposed
toward
him,
Stepan
Stepanovich
Adraksin.
Adraksin
was
in
uniform,
and
whether
as
a
result
of
the
uniform
or
from
some
other
cause
Pierre
saw
before
him
quite
a
different
man.
With
a
sudden
expression
of
malevolence
on
his
aged
face,
Adraksin
shouted
at
Pierre:
"In
the
first
place,
I
tell
you
we
have
no
right
to
question
the
Emperor
about
that,
and
secondly,
if
the
Russian
nobility
had
that
right,
the
Emperor
could
not
answer
such
a
question.
The
troops
are
moved
according
to
the
enemy's
movements
and
the
number
of
men
increases
and
decreases..."
Another
voice,
that
of
a
nobleman
of
medium
height
and
about
forty
years
of
age,
whom
Pierre
had
formerly
met
at
the
gypsies'
and
knew
as
a
bad
cardplayer,
and
who,
also
transformed
by
his
uniform,
came
up
to
Pierre,
interrupted
Adraksin.
"Yes,
and
this
is
not
a
time
for
discussing,"
he
continued,
"but
for
acting:
there
is
war
in
Russia!
The
enemy
is
advancing
to
destroy
Russia,
to
desecrate
the
tombs
of
our
fathers,
to
carry
off
our
wives
and
children."
The
nobleman
smote
his
breast.
"We
will
all
arise,
every
one
of
us
will
go,
for
our
father
the
Tsar!"
he
shouted,
rolling
his
bloodshot
eyes.
Several
approving
voices
were
heard
in
the
crowd.
"We
are
Russians
and
will
not
grudge
our
blood
in
defense
of
our
faith,
the
throne,
and
the
Fatherland!
We
must
cease
raving
if
we
are
sons
of
our
Fatherland!
We
will
show
Europe
how
Russia
rises
to
the
defense
of
Russia!"
Pierre
wished
to
reply,
but
could
not
get
in
a
word.
He
felt
that
his
words,
apart
from
what
meaning
they
conveyed,
were
less
audible
than
the
sound
of
his
opponent's
voice.
Count
Rostov
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
was
expressing
approval;
several
persons,
briskly
turning
a
shoulder
to
the
orator
at
the
end
of
a
phrase,
said:
"That's
right,
quite
right!
Just
so!"
Pierre
wished
to
say
that
he
was
ready
to
sacrifice
his
money,
his
serfs,
or
himself,
only
one
ought
to
know
the
state
of
affairs
in
order
to
be
able
to
improve
it,
but
he
was
unable
to
speak.
Many
voices
shouted
and
talked
at
the
same
time,
so
that
Count
Rostov
had
not
time
to
signify
his
approval
of
them
all,
and
the
group
increased,
dispersed,
re-formed,
and
then
moved
with
a
hum
of
talk
into
the
largest
hall
and
to
the
big
table.
Not
only
was
Pierre's
attempt
to
speak
unsuccessful,
but
he
was
rudely
interrupted,
pushed
aside,
and
people
turned
away
from
him
as
from
a
common
enemy.
This
happened
not
because
they
were
displeased
by
the
substance
of
his
speech,
which
had
even
been
forgotten
after
the
many
subsequent
speeches,
but
to
animate
it
the
crowd
needed
a
tangible
object
to
love
and
a
tangible
object
to
hate.
Pierre
became
the
latter.
Many
other
orators
spoke
after
the
excited
nobleman,
and
all
in
the
same
tone.
Many
spoke
eloquently
and
with
originality.
Glinka,
the
editor
of
the
Russian
Messenger,
who
was
recognized
(cries
of
"author!
author!"
were
heard
in
the
crowd),
said
that
"hell
must
be
repulsed
by
hell,"
and
that
he
had
seen
a
child
smiling
at
lightning
flashes
and
thunderclaps,
but
"we
will
not
be
that
child."
"Yes,
yes,
at
thunderclaps!"
was
repeated
approvingly
in
the
back
rows
of
the
crowd.
The
crowd
drew
up
to
the
large
table,
at
which
sat
gray-haired
or
bald
seventy-year-old
magnates,
uniformed
and
besashed
almost
all
of
whom
Pierre
had
seen
in
their
own
homes
with
their
buffoons,
or
playing
boston
at
the
clubs.
With
an
incessant
hum
of
voices
the
crowd
advanced
to
the
table.
Pressed
by
the
throng
against
the
high
backs
of
the
chairs,
the
orators
spoke
one
after
another
and
sometimes
two
together.
Those
standing
behind
noticed
what
a
speaker
omitted
to
say
and
hastened
to
supply
it.
Others
in
that
heat
and
crush
racked
their
brains
to
find
some
thought
and
hastened
to
utter
it.
The
old
magnates,
whom
Pierre
knew,
sat
and
turned
to
look
first
at
one
and
then
at
another,
and
their
faces
for
the
most
part
only
expressed
the
fact
that
they
found
it
very
hot.
Pierre,
however,
felt
excited,
and
the
general
desire
to
show
that
they
were
ready
to
go
to
all
lengths--which
found
expression
in
the
tones
and
looks
more
than
in
the
substance
of
the
speeches--infected
him
too.
He
did
not
renounce
his
opinions,
but
felt
himself
in
some
way
to
blame
and
wished
to
justify
himself.
"I
only
said
that
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
to
make
sacrifices
when
we
know
what
is
needed!"
said
he,
trying
to
be
heard
above
the
other
voices.
One
of
the
old
men
nearest
to
him
looked
round,
but
his
attention
was
immediately
diverted
by
an
exclamation
at
the
other
side
of
the
table.
"Yes,
Moscow
will
be
surrendered!
She
will
be
our
expiation!"
shouted
one
man.
"He
is
the
enemy
of
mankind!"
cried
another.
"Allow
me
to
speak...."
"Gentlemen,
you
are
crushing
me!..."
CHAPTER
XXIII
At
that
moment
Count
Rostopchin
with
his
protruding
chin
and
alert
eyes,
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
general
with
sash
over
his
shoulder,
entered
the
room,
stepping
briskly
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
of
gentry.
"Our
sovereign
the
Emperor
will
be
here
in
a
moment,"
said
Rostopchin.
"I
am
straight
from
the
palace.
Seeing
the
position
we
are
in,
I
think
there
is
little
need
for
discussion.
The
Emperor
has
deigned
to
summon
us
and
the
merchants.
Millions
will
pour
forth
from
there"--he
pointed
to
the
merchants'
hall--"but
our
business
is
to
supply
men
and
not
spare
ourselves...
That
is
the
least
we
can
do!"
A
conference
took
place
confined
to
the
magnates
sitting
at
the
table.
The
whole
consultation
passed
more
than
quietly.
After
all
the
preceding
noise
the
sound
of
their
old
voices
saying
one
after
another,
"I
agree,"
or
for
variety,
"I
too
am
of
that
opinion,"
and
so
on
had
even
a
mournful
effect.
The
secretary
was
told
to
write
down
the
resolution
of
the
Moscow
nobility
and
gentry,
that
they
would
furnish
ten
men,
fully
equipped,
out
of
every
thousand
serfs,
as
the
Smolensk
gentry
had
done.
Their
chairs
made
a
scraping
noise
as
the
gentlemen
who
had
conferred
rose
with
apparent
relief,
and
began
walking
up
and
down,
arm
in
arm,
to
stretch
their
legs
and
converse
in
couples.
"The
Emperor!
The
Emperor!"
a
sudden
cry
resounded
through
the
halls
and
the
whole
throng
hurried
to
the
entrance.
The
Emperor
entered
the
hall
through
a
broad
path
between
two
lines
of
nobles.
Every
face
expressed
respectful,
awe-struck
curiosity.
Pierre
stood
rather
far
off
and
could
not
hear
all
that
the
Emperor
said.
From
what
he
did
hear
he
understood
that
the
Emperor
spoke
of
the
danger
threatening
the
empire
and
of
the
hopes
he
placed
on
the
Moscow
nobility.
He
was
answered
by
a
voice
which
informed
him
of
the
resolution
just
arrived
at.
"Gentlemen!"
said
the
Emperor
with
a
quivering
voice.
There
was
a
rustling
among
the
crowd
and
it
again
subsided,
so
that
Pierre
distinctly
heard
the
pleasantly
human
voice
of
the
Emperor
saying
with
emotion:
"I
never
doubted
the
devotion
of
the
Russian
nobles,
but
today
it
has
surpassed
my
expectations.
I
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
Fatherland!
Gentlemen,
let
us
act!
Time
is
most
precious..."
The
Emperor
ceased
speaking,
the
crowd
began
pressing
round
him,
and
rapturous
exclamations
were
heard
from
all
sides.
"Yes,
most
precious...
a
royal
word,"
said
Count
Rostov,
with
a
sob.
He
stood
at
the
back,
and,
though
he
had
heard
hardly
anything,
understood
everything
in
his
own
way.
From
the
hall
of
the
nobility
the
Emperor
went
to
that
of
the
merchants.
There
he
remained
about
ten
minutes.
Pierre
was
among
those
who
saw
him
come
out
from
the
merchants'
hall
with
tears
of
emotion
in
his
eyes.
As
became
known
later,
he
had
scarcely
begun
to
address
the
merchants
before
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
and
he
concluded
in
a
trembling
voice.
When
Pierre
saw
the
Emperor
he
was
coming
out
accompanied
by
two
merchants,
one
of
whom
Pierre
knew,
a
fat
otkupshchik.
The
other
was
the
mayor,
a
man
with
a
thin
sallow
face
and
narrow
beard.
Both
were
weeping.
Tears
filled
the
thin
man's
eyes,
and
the
fat
otkupshchik
sobbed
outright
like
a
child
and
kept
repeating:
"Our
lives
and
property--take
them,
Your
Majesty!"
Pierre's
one
feeling
at
the
moment
was
a
desire
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
go
all
lengths
and
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
everything.
He
now
felt
ashamed
of
his
speech
with
its
constitutional
tendency
and
sought
an
opportunity
of
effacing
it.
Having
heard
that
Count
Mamonov
was
furnishing
a
regiment,
Bezukhov
at
once
informed
Rostopchin
that
he
would
give
a
thousand
men
and
their
maintenance.
Old
Rostov
could
not
tell
his
wife
of
what
had
passed
without
tears,
and
at
once
consented
to
Petya's
request
and
went
himself
to
enter
his
name.
Next
day
the
Emperor
left
Moscow.
The
assembled
nobles
all
took
off
their
uniforms
and
settled
down
again
in
their
homes
and
clubs,
and
not
without
some
groans
gave
orders
to
their
stewards
about
the
enrollment,
feeling
amazed
themselves
at
what
they
had
done.
BOOK
TEN:
1812
CHAPTER
I
Napoleon
began
the
war
with
Russia
because
he
could
not
resist
going
to
Dresden,
could
not
help
having
his
head
turned
by
the
homage
he
received,
could
not
help
donning
a
Polish
uniform
and
yielding
to
the
stimulating
influence
of
a
June
morning,
and
could
not
refrain
from
bursts
of
anger
in
the
presence
of
Kurakin
and
then
of
Balashev.
Alexander
refused
negotiations
because
he
felt
himself
to
be
personally
insulted.
Barclay
de
Tolly
tried
to
command
the
army
in
the
best
way,
because
he
wished
to
fulfill
his
duty
and
earn
fame
as
a
great
commander.
Rostov
charged
the
French
because
he
could
not
restrain
his
wish
for
a
gallop
across
a
level
field;
and
in
the
same
way
the
innumerable
people
who
took
part
in
the
war
acted
in
accord
with
their
personal
characteristics,
habits,
circumstances,
and
aims.
They
were
moved
by
fear
or
vanity,
rejoiced
or
were
indignant,
reasoned,
imagining
that
they
knew
what
they
were
doing
and
did
it
of
their
own
free
will,
but
they
all
were
involuntary
tools
of
history,
carrying
on
a
work
concealed
from
them
but
comprehensible
to
us.
Such
is
the
inevitable
fate
of
men
of
action,
and
the
higher
they
stand
in
the
social
hierarchy
the
less
are
they
free.
The
actors
of
1812
have
long
since
left
the
stage,
their
personal
interests
have
vanished
leaving
no
trace,
and
nothing
remains
of
that
time
but
its
historic
results.
Providence
compelled
all
these
men,
striving
to
attain
personal
aims,
to
further
the
accomplishment
of
a
stupendous
result
no
one
of
them
at
all
expected--neither
Napoleon,
nor
Alexander,
nor
still
less
any
of
those
who
did
the
actual
fighting.
The
cause
of
the
destruction
of
the
French
army
in
1812
is
clear
to
us
now.
No
one
will
deny
that
that
cause
was,
on
the
one
hand,
its
advance
into
the
heart
of
Russia
late
in
the
season
without
any
preparation
for
a
winter
campaign
and,
on
the
other,
the
character
given
to
the
war
by
the
burning
of
Russian
towns
and
the
hatred
of
the
foe
this
aroused
among
the
Russian
people.
But
no
one
at
the
time
foresaw
(what
now
seems
so
evident)
that
this
was
the
only
way
an
army
of
eight
hundred
thousand
men--the
best
in
the
world
and
led
by
the
best
general--could
be
destroyed
in
conflict
with
a
raw
army
of
half
its
numerical
strength,
and
led
by
inexperienced
commanders
as
the
Russian
army
was.
Not
only
did
no
one
see
this,
but
on
the
Russian
side
every
effort
was
made
to
hinder
the
only
thing
that
could
save
Russia,
while
on
the
French
side,
despite
Napoleon's
experience
and
so-called
military
genius,
every
effort
was
directed
to
pushing
on
to
Moscow
at
the
end
of
the
summer,
that
is,
to
doing
the
very
thing
that
was
bound
to
lead
to
destruction.
In
historical
works
on
the
year
1812
French
writers
are
very
fond
of
saying
that
Napoleon
felt
the
danger
of
extending
his
line,
that
he
sought
a
battle
and
that
his
marshals
advised
him
to
stop
at
Smolensk,
and
of
making
similar
statements
to
show
that
the
danger
of
the
campaign
was
even
then
understood.
Russian
authors
are
still
fonder
of
telling
us
that
from
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
a
Scythian
war
plan
was
adopted
to
lure
Napoleon
into
the
depths
of
Russia,
and
this
plan
some
of
them
attribute
to
Pfuel,
others
to
a
certain
Frenchman,
others
to
Toll,
and
others
again
to
Alexander
himself--pointing
to
notes,
projects,
and
letters
which
contain
hints
of
such
a
line
of
action.
But
all
these
hints
at
what
happened,
both
from
the
French
side
and
the
Russian,
are
advanced
only
because
they
fit
in
with
the
event.
Had
that
event
not
occurred
these
hints
would
have
been
forgotten,
as
we
have
forgotten
the
thousands
and
millions
of
hints
and
expectations
to
the
contrary
which
were
current
then
but
have
now
been
forgotten
because
the
event
falsified
them.
There
are
always
so
many
conjectures
as
to
the
issue
of
any
event
that
however
it
may
end
there
will
always
be
people
to
say:
"I
said
then
that
it
would
be
so,"
quite
forgetting
that
amid
their
innumerable
conjectures
many
were
to
quite
the
contrary
effect.
Conjectures
as
to
Napoleon's
awareness
of
the
danger
of
extending
his
line,
and
(on
the
Russian
side)
as
to
luring
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
Russia,
are
evidently
of
that
kind,
and
only
by
much
straining
can
historians
attribute
such
conceptions
to
Napoleon
and
his
marshals,
or
such
plans
to
the
Russian
commanders.
All
the
facts
are
in
flat
contradiction
to
such
conjectures.
During
the
whole
period
of
the
war
not
only
was
there
no
wish
on
the
Russian
side
to
draw
the
French
into
the
heart
of
the
country,
but
from
their
first
entry
into
Russia
everything
was
done
to
stop
them.
And
not
only
was
Napoleon
not
afraid
to
extend
his
line,
but
he
welcomed
every
step
forward
as
a
triumph
and
did
not
seek
battle
as
eagerly
as
in
former
campaigns,
but
very
lazily.
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
our
armies
were
divided,
and
our
sole
aim
was
to
unite
them,
though
uniting
the
armies
was
no
advantage
if
we
meant
to
retire
and
lure
the
enemy
into
the
depths
of
the
country.
Our
Emperor
joined
the
army
to
encourage
it
to
defend
every
inch
of
Russian
soil
and
not
to
retreat.
The
enormous
Drissa
camp
was
formed
on
Pfuel's
plan,
and
there
was
no
intention
of
retiring
farther.
The
Emperor
reproached
the
commanders
in
chief
for
every
step
they
retired.
He
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
letting
the
enemy
even
reach
Smolensk,
still
less
could
he
contemplate
the
burning
of
Moscow,
and
when
our
armies
did
unite
he
was
displeased
that
Smolensk
was
abandoned
and
burned
without
a
general
engagement
having
been
fought
under
its
walls.
So
thought
the
Emperor,
and
the
Russian
commanders
and
people
were
still
more
provoked
at
the
thought
that
our
forces
were
retreating
into
the
depths
of
the
country.
Napoleon
having
cut
our
armies
apart
advanced
far
into
the
country
and
missed
several
chances
of
forcing
an
engagement.
In
August
he
was
at
Smolensk
and
thought
only
of
how
to
advance
farther,
though
as
we
now
see
that
advance
was
evidently
ruinous
to
him.
The
facts
clearly
show
that
Napoleon
did
not
foresee
the
danger
of
the
advance
on
Moscow,
nor
did
Alexander
and
the
Russian
commanders
then
think
of
luring
Napoleon
on,
but
quite
the
contrary.
The
luring
of
Napoleon
into
the
depths
of
the
country
was
not
the
result
of
any
plan,
for
no
one
believed
it
to
be
possible;
it
resulted
from
a
most
complex
interplay
of
intrigues,
aims,
and
wishes
among
those
who
took
part
in
the
war
and
had
no
perception
whatever
of
the
inevitable,
or
of
the
one
way
of
saving
Russia.
Everything
came
about
fortuitously.
The
armies
were
divided
at
the
commencement
of
the
campaign.
We
tried
to
unite
them,
with
the
evident
intention
of
giving
battle
and
checking
the
enemy's
advance,
and
by
this
effort
to
unite
them
while
avoiding
battle
with
a
much
stronger
enemy,
and
necessarily
withdrawing
the
armies
at
an
acute
angle--we
led
the
French
on
to
Smolensk.
But
we
withdrew
at
an
acute
angle
not
only
because
the
French
advanced
between
our
two
armies;
the
angle
became
still
more
acute
and
we
withdrew
still
farther,
because
Barclay
de
Tolly
was
an
unpopular
foreigner
disliked
by
Bagration
(who
would
come
under
his
command),
and
Bagration--being
in
command
of
the
second
army--tried
to
postpone
joining
up
and
coming
under
Barclay's
command
as
long
as
he
could.
Bagration
was
slow
in
effecting
the
junction--though
that
was
the
chief
aim
of
all
at
headquarters--because,
as
he
alleged,
he
exposed
his
army
to
danger
on
this
march,
and
it
was
best
for
him
to
retire
more
to
the
left
and
more
to
the
south,
worrying
the
enemy
from
flank
and
rear
and
securing
from
the
Ukraine
recruits
for
his
army;
and
it
looks
as
if
he
planned
this
in
order
not
to
come
under
the
command
of
the
detested
foreigner
Barclay,
whose
rank
was
inferior
to
his
own.
The
Emperor
was
with
the
army
to
encourage
it,
but
his
presence
and
ignorance
of
what
steps
to
take,
and
the
enormous
number
of
advisers
and
plans,
destroyed
the
first
army's
energy
and
it
retired.
The
intention
was
to
make
a
stand
at
the
Drissa
camp,
but
Paulucci,
aiming
at
becoming
commander-in-chief,
unexpectedly
employed
his
energy
to
influence
Alexander,
and
Pfuel's
whole
plan
was
abandoned
and
the
command
entrusted
to
Barclay.
But
as
Barclay
did
not
inspire
confidence
his
power
was
limited.
The
armies
were
divided,
there
was
no
unity
of
command,
and
Barclay
was
unpopular;
but
from
this
confusion,
division,
and
the
unpopularity
of
the
foreign
commander-in-chief,
there
resulted
on
the
one
hand
indecision
and
the
avoidance
of
a
battle
(which
we
could
not
have
refrained
from
had
the
armies
been
united
and
had
someone
else,
instead
of
Barclay,
been
in
command)
and
on
the
other
an
ever-increasing
indignation
against
the
foreigners
and
an
increase
in
patriotic
zeal.
At
last
the
Emperor
left
the
army,
and
as
the
most
convenient
and
indeed
the
only
pretext
for
his
departure
it
was
decided
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
inspire
the
people
in
the
capitals
and
arouse
the
nation
in
general
to
a
patriotic
war.
And
by
this
visit
of
the
Emperor
to
Moscow
the
strength
of
the
Russian
army
was
trebled.
He
left
in
order
not
to
obstruct
the
commander-in-chief's
undivided
control
of
the
army,
and
hoping
that
more
decisive
action
would
then
be
taken,
but
the
command
of
the
armies
became
still
more
confused
and
enfeebled.
Bennigsen,
the
Tsarevich,
and
a
swarm
of
adjutants
general
remained
with
the
army
to
keep
the
commander-in-chief
under
observation
and
arouse
his
energy,
and
Barclay,
feeling
less
free
than
ever
under
the
observation
of
all
these
"eyes
of
the
Emperor,"
became
still
more
cautious
of
undertaking
any
decisive
action
and
avoided
giving
battle.
Barclay
stood
for
caution.
The
Tsarevich
hinted
at
treachery
and
demanded
a
general
engagement.
Lubomirski,
Bronnitski,
Wlocki,
and
the
others
of
that
group
stirred
up
so
much
trouble
that
Barclay,
under
pretext
of
sending
papers
to
the
Emperor,
dispatched
these
Polish
adjutants
general
to
Petersburg
and
plunged
into
an
open
struggle
with
Bennigsen
and
the
Tsarevich.
At
Smolensk
the
armies
at
last
reunited,
much
as
Bagration
disliked
it.
Bagration
drove
up
in
a
carriage
to
the
house
occupied
by
Barclay.
Barclay
donned
his
sash
and
came
out
to
meet
and
report
to
his
senior
officer
Bagration.
Despite
his
seniority
in
rank
Bagration,
in
this
contest
of
magnanimity,
took
his
orders
from
Barclay,
but,
having
submitted,
agreed
with
him
less
than
ever.
By
the
Emperor's
orders
Bagration
reported
direct
to
him.
He
wrote
to
Arakcheev,
the
Emperor's
confidant:
"It
must
be
as
my
sovereign
pleases,
but
I
cannot
work
with
the
Minister
(meaning
Barclay).
For
God's
sake
send
me
somewhere
else
if
only
in
command
of
a
regiment.
I
cannot
stand
it
here.
Headquarters
are
so
full
of
Germans
that
a
Russian
cannot
exist
and
there
is
no
sense
in
anything.
I
thought
I
was
really
serving
my
sovereign
and
the
Fatherland,
but
it
turns
out
that
I
am
serving
Barclay.
I
confess
I
do
not
want
to."
The
swarm
of
Bronnitskis
and
Wintzingerodes
and
their
like
still
further
embittered
the
relations
between
the
commanders
in
chief,
and
even
less
unity
resulted.
Preparations
were
made
to
fight
the
French
before
Smolensk.
A
general
was
sent
to
survey
the
position.
This
general,
hating
Barclay,
rode
to
visit
a
friend
of
his
own,
a
corps
commander,
and,
having
spent
the
day
with
him,
returned
to
Barclay
and
condemned,
as
unsuitable
from
every
point
of
view,
the
battleground
he
had
not
seen.
While
disputes
and
intrigues
were
going
on
about
the
future
field
of
battle,
and
while
we
were
looking
for
the
French--having
lost
touch
with
them--the
French
stumbled
upon
Neverovski's
division
and
reached
the
walls
of
Smolensk.
It
was
necessary
to
fight
an
unexpected
battle
at
Smolensk
to
save
our
lines
of
communication.
The
battle
was
fought
and
thousands
were
killed
on
both
sides.
Smolensk
was
abandoned
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
Emperor
and
of
the
whole
people.
But
Smolensk
was
burned
by
its
own
inhabitants-who
had
been
misled
by
their
governor.
And
these
ruined
inhabitants,
setting
an
example
to
other
Russians,
went
to
Moscow
thinking
only
of
their
own
losses
but
kindling
hatred
of
the
foe.
Napoleon
advanced
farther
and
we
retired,
thus
arriving
at
the
very
result
which
caused
his
destruction.
CHAPTER
II
The
day
after
his
son
had
left,
Prince
Nicholas
sent
for
Princess
Mary
to
come
to
his
study.
"Well?
Are
you
satisfied
now?"
said
he.
"You've
made
me
quarrel
with
my
son!
Satisfied,
are
you?
That's
all
you
wanted!
Satisfied?...
It
hurts
me,
it
hurts.
I'm
old
and
weak
and
this
is
what
you
wanted.
Well
then,
gloat
over
it!
Gloat
over
it!"
After
that
Princess
Mary
did
not
see
her
father
for
a
whole
week.
He
was
ill
and
did
not
leave
his
study.
Princess
Mary
noticed
to
her
surprise
that
during
this
illness
the
old
prince
not
only
excluded
her
from
his
room,
but
did
not
admit
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
either.
Tikhon
alone
attended
him.
At
the
end
of
the
week
the
prince
reappeared
and
resumed
his
former
way
of
life,
devoting
himself
with
special
activity
to
building
operations
and
the
arrangement
of
the
gardens
and
completely
breaking
off
his
relations
with
Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
His
looks
and
cold
tone
to
his
daughter
seemed
to
say:
"There,
you
see?
You
plotted
against
me,
you
lied
to
Prince
Andrew
about
my
relations
with
that
Frenchwoman
and
made
me
quarrel
with
him,
but
you
see
I
need
neither
her
nor
you!"
Princess
Mary
spent
half
of
every
day
with
little
Nicholas,
watching
his
lessons,
teaching
him
Russian
and
music
herself,
and
talking
to
Dessalles;
the
rest
of
the
day
she
spent
over
her
books,
with
her
old
nurse,
or
with
"God's
folk"
who
sometimes
came
by
the
back
door
to
see
her.
Of
the
war
Princess
Mary
thought
as
women
do
think
about
wars.
She
feared
for
her
brother
who
was
in
it,
was
horrified
by
and
amazed
at
the
strange
cruelty
that
impels
men
to
kill
one
another,
but
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
this
war,
which
seemed
to
her
like
all
previous
wars.
She
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
war,
though
Dessalles
with
whom
she
constantly
conversed
was
passionately
interested
in
its
progress
and
tried
to
explain
his
own
conception
of
it
to
her,
and
though
the
"God's
folk"
who
came
to
see
her
reported,
in
their
own
way,
the
rumors
current
among
the
people
of
an
invasion
by
Antichrist,
and
though
Julie
(now
Princess
Drubetskaya),
who
had
resumed
correspondence
with
her,
wrote
patriotic
letters
from
Moscow.
"I
write
you
in
Russian,
my
good
friend,"
wrote
Julie
in
her
Frenchified
Russian,
"because
I
have
a
detestation
for
all
the
French,
and
the
same
for
their
language
which
I
cannot
support
to
hear
spoken....
We
in
Moscow
are
elated
by
enthusiasm
for
our
adored
Emperor.
"My
poor
husband
is
enduring
pains
and
hunger
in
Jewish
taverns,
but
the
news
which
I
have
inspires
me
yet
more.
"You
heard
probably
of
the
heroic
exploit
of
Raevski,
embracing
his
two
sons
and
saying:
'I
will
perish
with
them
but
we
will
not
be
shaken!'
And
truly
though
the
enemy
was
twice
stronger
than
we,
we
were
unshakable.
We
pass
the
time
as
we
can,
but
in
war
as
in
war!
The
princesses
Aline
and
Sophie
sit
whole
days
with
me,
and
we,
unhappy
widows
of
live
men,
make
beautiful
conversations
over
our
'charpie',
only
you,
my
friend,
are
missing..."
and
so
on.
The
chief
reason
Princess
Mary
did
not
realize
the
full
significance
of
this
war
was
that
the
old
prince
never
spoke
of
it,
did
not
recognize
it,
and
laughed
at
Dessalles
when
he
mentioned
it
at
dinner.
The
prince's
tone
was
so
calm
and
confident
that
Princess
Mary
unhesitatingly
believed
him.
All
that
July
the
old
prince
was
exceedingly
active
and
even
animated.
He
planned
another
garden
and
began
a
new
building
for
the
domestic
serfs.
The
only
thing
that
made
Princess
Mary
anxious
about
him
was
that
he
slept
very
little
and,
instead
of
sleeping
in
his
study
as
usual,
changed
his
sleeping
place
every
day.
One
day
he
would
order
his
camp
bed
to
be
set
up
in
the
glass
gallery,
another
day
he
remained
on
the
couch
or
on
the
lounge
chair
in
the
drawing
room
and
dozed
there
without
undressing,
while--instead
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne--a
serf
boy
read
to
him.
Then
again
he
would
spend
a
night
in
the
dining
room.
On
August
1,
a
second
letter
was
received
from
Prince
Andrew.
In
his
first
letter
which
came
soon
after
he
had
left
home,
Prince
Andrew
had
dutifully
asked
his
father's
forgiveness
for
what
he
had
allowed
himself
to
say
and
begged
to
be
restored
to
his
favor.
To
this
letter
the
old
prince
had
replied
affectionately,
and
from
that
time
had
kept
the
Frenchwoman
at
a
distance.
Prince
Andrew's
second
letter,
written
near
Vitebsk
after
the
French
had
occupied
that
town,
gave
a
brief
account
of
the
whole
campaign,
enclosed
for
them
a
plan
he
had
drawn
and
forecasts
as
to
the
further
progress
of
the
war.
In
this
letter
Prince
Andrew
pointed
out
to
his
father
the
danger
of
staying
at
Bald
Hills,
so
near
the
theater
of
war
and
on
the
army's
direct
line
of
march,
and
advised
him
to
move
to
Moscow.
At
dinner
that
day,
on
Dessalles'
mentioning
that
the
French
were
said
to
have
already
entered
Vitebsk,
the
old
prince
remembered
his
son's
letter.
"There
was
a
letter
from
Prince
Andrew
today,"
he
said
to
Princess
Mary-
-"Haven't
you
read
it?"
"No,
Father,"
she
replied
in
a
frightened
voice.
She
could
not
have
read
the
letter
as
she
did
not
even
know
it
had
arrived.
"He
writes
about
this
war,"
said
the
prince,
with
the
ironic
smile
that
had
become
habitual
to
him
in
speaking
of
the
present
war.
"That
must
be
very
interesting,"
said
Dessalles.
"Prince
Andrew
is
in
a
position
to
know..."
"Oh,
very
interesting!"
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
"Go
and
get
it
for
me,"
said
the
old
prince
to
Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
"You
know--under
the
paperweight
on
the
little
table."
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
jumped
up
eagerly.
"No,
don't!"
he
exclaimed
with
a
frown.
"You
go,
Michael
Ivanovich."
Michael
Ivanovich
rose
and
went
to
the
study.
But
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
the
old
prince,
looking
uneasily
round,
threw
down
his
napkin
and
went
himself.
"They
can't
do
anything...
always
make
some
muddle,"
he
muttered.
While
he
was
away
Princess
Mary,
Dessalles,
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
and
even
little
Nicholas
exchanged
looks
in
silence.
The
old
prince
returned
with
quick
steps,
accompanied
by
Michael
Ivanovich,
bringing
the
letter
and
a
plan.
These
he
put
down
beside
him--not
letting
anyone
read
them
at
dinner.
On
moving
to
the
drawing
room
he
handed
the
letter
to
Princess
Mary
and,
spreading
out
before
him
the
plan
of
the
new
building
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it,
told
her
to
read
the
letter
aloud.
When
she
had
done
so
Princess
Mary
looked
inquiringly
at
her
father.
He
was
examining
the
plan,
evidently
engrossed
in
his
own
ideas.
"What
do
you
think
of
it,
Prince?"
Dessalles
ventured
to
ask.
"I?
I?..."
said
the
prince
as
if
unpleasantly
awakened,
and
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
plan
of
the
building.
"Very
possibly
the
theater
of
war
will
move
so
near
to
us
that..."
"Ha
ha
ha!
The
theater
of
war!"
said
the
prince.
"I
have
said
and
still
say
that
the
theater
of
war
is
Poland
and
the
enemy
will
never
get
beyond
the
Niemen."
Dessalles
looked
in
amazement
at
the
prince,
who
was
talking
of
the
Niemen
when
the
enemy
was
already
at
the
Dnieper,
but
Princess
Mary,
forgetting
the
geographical
position
of
the
Niemen,
thought
that
what
her
father
was
saying
was
correct.
"When
the
snow
melts
they'll
sink
in
the
Polish
swamps.
Only
they
could
fail
to
see
it,"
the
prince
continued,
evidently
thinking
of
the
campaign
of
1807
which
seemed
to
him
so
recent.
"Bennigsen
should
have
advanced
into
Prussia
sooner,
then
things
would
have
taken
a
different
turn..."
"But,
Prince,"
Dessalles
began
timidly,
"the
letter
mentions
Vitebsk...."
"Ah,
the
letter?
Yes..."
replied
the
prince
peevishly.
"Yes...
yes..."
His
face
suddenly
took
on
a
morose
expression.
He
paused.
"Yes,
he
writes
that
the
French
were
beaten
at...
at...
what
river
is
it?"
Dessalles
dropped
his
eyes.
"The
prince
says
nothing
about
that,"
he
remarked
gently.
"Doesn't
he?
But
I
didn't
invent
it
myself."
No
one
spoke
for
a
long
time.
"Yes...
yes...
Well,
Michael
Ivanovich,"
he
suddenly
went
on,
raising
his
head
and
pointing
to
the
plan
of
the
building,
"tell
me
how
you
mean
to
alter
it...."
Michael
Ivanovich
went
up
to
the
plan,
and
the
prince
after
speaking
to
him
about
the
building
looked
angrily
at
Princess
Mary
and
Dessalles
and
went
to
his
own
room.
Princess
Mary
saw
Dessalles'
embarrassed
and
astonished
look
fixed
on
her
father,
noticed
his
silence,
and
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
her
father
had
forgotten
his
son's
letter
on
the
drawing-room
table;
but
she
was
not
only
afraid
to
speak
of
it
and
ask
Dessalles
the
reason
of
his
confusion
and
silence,
but
was
afraid
even
to
think
about
it.
In
the
evening
Michael
Ivanovich,
sent
by
the
prince,
came
to
Princess
Mary
for
Prince
Andrew's
letter
which
had
been
forgotten
in
the
drawing
room.
She
gave
it
to
him
and,
unpleasant
as
it
was
to
her
to
do
so,
ventured
to
ask
him
what
her
father
was
doing.
"Always
busy,"
replied
Michael
Ivanovich
with
a
respectfully
ironic
smile
which
caused
Princess
Mary
to
turn
pale.
"He's
worrying
very
much
about
the
new
building.
He
has
been
reading
a
little,
but
now"--Michael
Ivanovich
went
on,
lowering
his
voice--"now
he's
at
his
desk,
busy
with
his
will,
I
expect."
(One
of
the
prince's
favorite
occupations
of
late
had
been
the
preparation
of
some
papers
he
meant
to
leave
at
his
death
and
which
he
called
his
"will.")
"And
Alpatych
is
being
sent
to
Smolensk?"
asked
Princess
Mary.
"Oh,
yes,
he
has
been
waiting
to
start
for
some
time."
CHAPTER
III
When
Michael
Ivanovich
returned
to
the
study
with
the
letter,
the
old
prince,
with
spectacles
on
and
a
shade
over
his
eyes,
was
sitting
at
his
open
bureau
with
screened
candles,
holding
a
paper
in
his
outstretched
hand,
and
in
a
somewhat
dramatic
attitude
was
reading
his
manuscript--
his
"Remarks"
as
he
termed
it--which
was
to
be
transmitted
to
the
Emperor
after
his
death.
When
Michael
Ivanovich
went
in
there
were
tears
in
the
prince's
eyes
evoked
by
the
memory
of
the
time
when
the
paper
he
was
now
reading
had
been
written.
He
took
the
letter
from
Michael
Ivanovich's
hand,
put
it
in
his
pocket,
folded
up
his
papers,
and
called
in
Alpatych
who
had
long
been
waiting.
The
prince
had
a
list
of
things
to
be
bought
in
Smolensk
and,
walking
up
and
down
the
room
past
Alpatych
who
stood
by
the
door,
he
gave
his
instructions.
"First,
notepaper--do
you
hear?
Eight
quires,
like
this
sample,
gilt-
edged...
it
must
be
exactly
like
the
sample.
Varnish,
sealing
wax,
as
in
Michael
Ivanovich's
list."
He
paced
up
and
down
for
a
while
and
glanced
at
his
notes.
"Then
hand
to
the
governor
in
person
a
letter
about
the
deed."
Next,
bolts
for
the
doors
of
the
new
building
were
wanted
and
had
to
be
of
a
special
shape
the
prince
had
himself
designed,
and
a
leather
case
had
to
be
ordered
to
keep
the
"will"
in.
The
instructions
to
Alpatych
took
over
two
hours
and
still
the
prince
did
not
let
him
go.
He
sat
down,
sank
into
thought,
closed
his
eyes,
and
dozed
off.
Alpatych
made
a
slight
movement.
"Well,
go,
go!
If
anything
more
is
wanted
I'll
send
after
you."
Alpatych
went
out.
The
prince
again
went
to
his
bureau,
glanced
into
it,
fingered
his
papers,
closed
the
bureau
again,
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
write
to
the
governor.
It
was
already
late
when
he
rose
after
sealing
the
letter.
He
wished
to
sleep,
but
he
knew
he
would
not
be
able
to
and
that
most
depressing
thoughts
came
to
him
in
bed.
So
he
called
Tikhon
and
went
through
the
rooms
with
him
to
show
him
where
to
set
up
the
bed
for
that
night.
He
went
about
looking
at
every
corner.
Every
place
seemed
unsatisfactory,
but
worst
of
all
was
his
customary
couch
in
the
study.
That
couch
was
dreadful
to
him,
probably
because
of
the
oppressive
thoughts
he
had
had
when
lying
there.
It
was
unsatisfactory
everywhere,
but
the
corner
behind
the
piano
in
the
sitting
room
was
better
than
other
places:
he
had
never
slept
there
yet.
With
the
help
of
a
footman
Tikhon
brought
in
the
bedstead
and
began
putting
it
up.
"That's
not
right!
That's
not
right!"
cried
the
prince,
and
himself
pushed
it
a
few
inches
from
the
corner
and
then
closer
in
again.
"Well,
at
last
I've
finished,
now
I'll
rest,"
thought
the
prince,
and
let
Tikhon
undress
him.
Frowning
with
vexation
at
the
effort
necessary
to
divest
himself
of
his
coat
and
trousers,
the
prince
undressed,
sat
down
heavily
on
the
bed,
and
appeared
to
be
meditating
as
he
looked
contemptuously
at
his
withered
yellow
legs.
He
was
not
meditating,
but
only
deferring
the
moment
of
making
the
effort
to
lift
those
legs
up
and
turn
over
on
the
bed.
"Ugh,
how
hard
it
is!
Oh,
that
this
toil
might
end
and
you
would
release
me!"
thought
he.
Pressing
his
lips
together
he
made
that
effort
for
the
twenty-thousandth
time
and
lay
down.
But
hardly
had
he
done
so
before
he
felt
the
bed
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
beneath
him
as
if
it
were
breathing
heavily
and
jolting.
This
happened
to
him
almost
every
night.
He
opened
his
eyes
as
they
were
closing.
"No
peace,
damn
them!"
he
muttered,
angry
he
knew
not
with
whom.
"Ah
yes,
there
was
something
else
important,
very
important,
that
I
was
keeping
till
I
should
be
in
bed.
The
bolts?
No,
I
told
him
about
them.
No,
it
was
something,
something
in
the
drawing
room.
Princess
Mary
talked
some
nonsense.
Dessalles,
that
fool,
said
something.
Something
in
my
pocket--can't
remember..."
"Tikhon,
what
did
we
talk
about
at
dinner?"
"About
Prince
Michael..."
"Be
quiet,
quiet!"
The
prince
slapped
his
hand
on
the
table.
"Yes,
I
know,
Prince
Andrew's
letter!
Princess
Mary
read
it.
Dessalles
said
something
about
Vitebsk.
Now
I'll
read
it."
He
had
the
letter
taken
from
his
pocket
and
the
table--on
which
stood
a
glass
of
lemonade
and
a
spiral
wax
candle--moved
close
to
the
bed,
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
began
reading.
Only
now
in
the
stillness
of
the
night,
reading
it
by
the
faint
light
under
the
green
shade,
did
he
grasp
its
meaning
for
a
moment.
"The
French
at
Vitebsk,
in
four
days'
march
they
may
be
at
Smolensk;
perhaps
are
already
there!
Tikhon!"
Tikhon
jumped
up.
"No,
no,
I
don't
want
anything!"
he
shouted.
He
put
the
letter
under
the
candlestick
and
closed
his
eyes.
And
there
rose
before
him
the
Danube
at
bright
noonday:
reeds,
the
Russian
camp,
and
himself
a
young
general
without
a
wrinkle
on
his
ruddy
face,
vigorous
and
alert,
entering
Potemkin's
gaily
colored
tent,
and
a
burning
sense
of
jealousy
of
"the
favorite"
agitated
him
now
as
strongly
as
it
had
done
then.
He
recalled
all
the
words
spoken
at
that
first
meeting
with
Potemkin.
And
he
saw
before
him
a
plump,
rather
sallow-
faced,
short,
stout
woman,
the
Empress
Mother,
with
her
smile
and
her
words
at
her
first
gracious
reception
of
him,
and
then
that
same
face
on
the
catafalque,
and
the
encounter
he
had
with
Zubov
over
her
coffin
about
his
right
to
kiss
her
hand.
"Oh,
quicker,
quicker!
To
get
back
to
that
time
and
have
done
with
all
the
present!
Quicker,
quicker--and
that
they
should
leave
me
in
peace!"
CHAPTER
IV
Bald
Hills,
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski's
estate,
lay
forty
miles
east
from
Smolensk
and
two
miles
from
the
main
road
to
Moscow.
The
same
evening
that
the
prince
gave
his
instructions
to
Alpatych,
Dessalles,
having
asked
to
see
Princess
Mary,
told
her
that,
as
the
prince
was
not
very
well
and
was
taking
no
steps
to
secure
his
safety,
though
from
Prince
Andrew's
letter
it
was
evident
that
to
remain
at
Bald
Hills
might
be
dangerous,
he
respectfully
advised
her
to
send
a
letter
by
Alpatych
to
the
Provincial
Governor
at
Smolensk,
asking
him
to
let
her
know
the
state
of
affairs
and
the
extent
of
the
danger
to
which
Bald
Hills
was
exposed.
Dessalles
wrote
this
letter
to
the
Governor
for
Princess
Mary,
she
signed
it,
and
it
was
given
to
Alpatych
with
instructions
to
hand
it
to
the
Governor
and
to
come
back
as
quickly
as
possible
if
there
was
danger.
Having
received
all
his
orders
Alpatych,
wearing
a
white
beaver
hat--a
present
from
the
prince--and
carrying
a
stick
as
the
prince
did,
went
out
accompanied
by
his
family.
Three
well-fed
roans
stood
ready
harnessed
to
a
small
conveyance
with
a
leather
hood.
The
larger
bell
was
muffled
and
the
little
bells
on
the
harness
stuffed
with
paper.
The
prince
allowed
no
one
at
Bald
Hills
to
drive
with
ringing
bells;
but
on
a
long
journey
Alpatych
liked
to
have
them.
His
satellites--the
senior
clerk,
a
countinghouse
clerk,
a
scullery
maid,
a
cook,
two
old
women,
a
little
pageboy,
the
coachman,
and
various
domestic
serfs--were
seeing
him
off.
His
daughter
placed
chintz-covered
down
cushions
for
him
to
sit
on
and
behind
his
back.
His
old
sister-in-law
popped
in
a
small
bundle,
and
one
of
the
coachmen
helped
him
into
the
vehicle.
"There!
There!
Women's
fuss!
Women,
women!"
said
Alpatych,
puffing
and
speaking
rapidly
just
as
the
prince
did,
and
he
climbed
into
the
trap.
After
giving
the
clerk
orders
about
the
work
to
be
done,
Alpatych,
not
trying
to
imitate
the
prince
now,
lifted
the
hat
from
his
bald
head
and
crossed
himself
three
times.
"If
there
is
anything...
come
back,
Yakov
Alpatych!
For
Christ's
sake
think
of
us!"
cried
his
wife,
referring
to
the
rumors
of
war
and
the
enemy.
"Women,
women!
Women's
fuss!"
muttered
Alpatych
to
himself
and
started
on
his
journey,
looking
round
at
the
fields
of
yellow
rye
and
the
still-
green,
thickly
growing
oats,
and
at
other
quite
black
fields
just
being
plowed
a
second
time.
As
he
went
along
he
looked
with
pleasure
at
the
year's
splendid
crop
of
corn,
scrutinized
the
strips
of
ryefield
which
here
and
there
were
already
being
reaped,
made
his
calculations
as
to
the
sowing
and
the
harvest,
and
asked
himself
whether
he
had
not
forgotten
any
of
the
prince's
orders.
Having
baited
the
horses
twice
on
the
way,
he
arrived
at
the
town
toward
evening
on
the
fourth
of
August.
Alpatych
kept
meeting
and
overtaking
baggage
trains
and
troops
on
the
road.
As
he
approached
Smolensk
he
heard
the
sounds
of
distant
firing,
but
these
did
not
impress
him.
What
struck
him
most
was
the
sight
of
a
splendid
field
of
oats
in
which
a
camp
had
been
pitched
and
which
was
being
mown
down
by
the
soldiers,
evidently
for
fodder.
This
fact
impressed
Alpatych,
but
in
thinking
about
his
own
business
he
soon
forgot
it.
All
the
interests
of
his
life
for
more
than
thirty
years
had
been
bounded
by
the
will
of
the
prince,
and
he
never
went
beyond
that
limit.
Everything
not
connected
with
the
execution
of
the
prince's
orders
did
not
interest
and
did
not
even
exist
for
Alpatych.
On
reaching
Smolensk
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
August
he
put
up
in
the
Gachina
suburb
across
the
Dnieper,
at
the
inn
kept
by
Ferapontov,
where
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
putting
up
for
the
last
thirty
years.
Some
thirty
years
ago
Ferapontov,
by
Alpatych's
advice,
had
bought
a
wood
from
the
prince,
had
begun
to
trade,
and
now
had
a
house,
an
inn,
and
a
corn
dealer's
shop
in
that
province.
He
was
a
stout,
dark,
red-
faced
peasant
in
the
forties,
with
thick
lips,
a
broad
knob
of
a
nose,
similar
knobs
over
his
black
frowning
brows,
and
a
round
belly.
Wearing
a
waistcoat
over
his
cotton
shirt,
Ferapontov
was
standing
before
his
shop
which
opened
onto
the
street.
On
seeing
Alpatych
he
went
up
to
him.
"You're
welcome,
Yakov
Alpatych.
Folks
are
leaving
the
town,
but
you
have
come
to
it,"
said
he.
"Why
are
they
leaving
the
town?"
asked
Alpatych.
"That's
what
I
say.
Folks
are
foolish!
Always
afraid
of
the
French."
"Women's
fuss,
women's
fuss!"
said
Alpatych.
"Just
what
I
think,
Yakov
Alpatych.
What
I
say
is:
orders
have
been
given
not
to
let
them
in,
so
that
must
be
right.
And
the
peasants
are
asking
three
rubles
for
carting--it
isn't
Christian!"
Yakov
Alpatych
heard
without
heeding.
He
asked
for
a
samovar
and
for
hay
for
his
horses,
and
when
he
had
had
his
tea
he
went
to
bed.
All
night
long
troops
were
moving
past
the
inn.
Next
morning
Alpatych
donned
a
jacket
he
wore
only
in
town
and
went
out
on
business.
It
was
a
sunny
morning
and
by
eight
o'clock
it
was
already
hot.
"A
good
day
for
harvesting,"
thought
Alpatych.
From
beyond
the
town
firing
had
been
heard
since
early
morning.
At
eight
o'clock
the
booming
of
cannon
was
added
to
the
sound
of
musketry.
Many
people
were
hurrying
through
the
streets
and
there
were
many
soldiers,
but
cabs
were
still
driving
about,
tradesmen
stood
at
their
shops,
and
service
was
being
held
in
the
churches
as
usual.
Alpatych
went
to
the
shops,
to
government
offices,
to
the
post
office,
and
to
the
Governor's.
In
the
offices
and
shops
and
at
the
post
office
everyone
was
talking
about
the
army
and
about
the
enemy
who
was
already
attacking
the
town,
everybody
was
asking
what
should
be
done,
and
all
were
trying
to
calm
one
another.
In
front
of
the
Governor's
house
Alpatych
found
a
large
number
of
people,
Cossacks,
and
a
traveling
carriage
of
the
Governor's.
At
the
porch
he
met
two
of
the
landed
gentry,
one
of
whom
he
knew.
This
man,
an
ex-captain
of
police,
was
saying
angrily:
"It's
no
joke,
you
know!
It's
all
very
well
if
you're
single.
'One
man
though
undone
is
but
one,'
as
the
proverb
says,
but
with
thirteen
in
your
family
and
all
the
property...
They've
brought
us
to
utter
ruin!
What
sort
of
governors
are
they
to
do
that?
They
ought
to
be
hanged--the
brigands!..."
"Oh
come,
that's
enough!"
said
the
other.
"What
do
I
care?
Let
him
hear!
We're
not
dogs,"
said
the
ex-captain
of
police,
and
looking
round
he
noticed
Alpatych.
"Oh,
Yakov
Alpatych!
What
have
you
come
for?"
"To
see
the
Governor
by
his
excellency's
order,"
answered
Alpatych,
lifting
his
head
and
proudly
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
bosom
of
his
coat
as
he
always
did
when
he
mentioned
the
prince....
"He
has
ordered
me
to
inquire
into
the
position
of
affairs,"
he
added.
"Yes,
go
and
find
out!"
shouted
the
angry
gentleman.
"They've
brought
things
to
such
a
pass
that
there
are
no
carts
or
anything!...
There
it
is
again,
do
you
hear?"
said
he,
pointing
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
sounds
of
firing.
"They've
brought
us
all
to
ruin...
the
brigands!"
he
repeated,
and
descended
the
porch
steps.
Alpatych
swayed
his
head
and
went
upstairs.
In
the
waiting
room
were
tradesmen,
women,
and
officials,
looking
silently
at
one
another.
The
door
of
the
Governor's
room
opened
and
they
all
rose
and
moved
forward.
An
official
ran
out,
said
some
words
to
a
merchant,
called
a
stout
official
with
a
cross
hanging
on
his
neck
to
follow
him,
and
vanished
again,
evidently
wishing
to
avoid
the
inquiring
looks
and
questions
addressed
to
him.
Alpatych
moved
forward
and
next
time
the
official
came
out
addressed
him,
one
hand
placed
in
the
breast
of
his
buttoned
coat,
and
handed
him
two
letters.
"To
his
Honor
Baron
Asch,
from
General-in-Chief
Prince
Bolkonski,"
he
announced
with
such
solemnity
and
significance
that
the
official
turned
to
him
and
took
the
letters.
A
few
minutes
later
the
Governor
received
Alpatych
and
hurriedly
said
to
him:
"Inform
the
prince
and
princess
that
I
knew
nothing:
I
acted
on
the
highest
instructions--here..."
and
he
handed
a
paper
to
Alpatych.
"Still,
as
the
prince
is
unwell
my
advice
is
that
they
should
go
to
Moscow.
I
am
just
starting
myself.
Inform
them..."
But
the
Governor
did
not
finish:
a
dusty
perspiring
officer
ran
into
the
room
and
began
to
say
something
in
French.
The
Governor's
face
expressed
terror.
"Go,"
he
said,
nodding
his
head
to
Alpatych,
and
began
questioning
the
officer.
Eager,
frightened,
helpless
glances
were
turned
on
Alpatych
when
he
came
out
of
the
Governor's
room.
Involuntarily
listening
now
to
the
firing,
which
had
drawn
nearer
and
was
increasing
in
strength,
Alpatych
hurried
to
his
inn.
The
paper
handed
to
him
by
the
Governor
said
this:
"I
assure
you
that
the
town
of
Smolensk
is
not
in
the
slightest
danger
as
yet
and
it
is
unlikely
that
it
will
be
threatened
with
any.
I
from
the
one
side
and
Prince
Bagration
from
the
other
are
marching
to
unite
our
forces
before
Smolensk,
which
junction
will
be
effected
on
the
22nd
instant,
and
both
armies
with
their
united
forces
will
defend
our
compatriots
of
the
province
entrusted
to
your
care
till
our
efforts
shall
have
beaten
back
the
enemies
of
our
Fatherland,
or
till
the
last
warrior
in
our
valiant
ranks
has
perished.
From
this
you
will
see
that
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
of
Smolensk,
for
those
defended
by
two
such
brave
armies
may
feel
assured
of
victory."
(Instructions
from
Barclay
de
Tolly
to
Baron
Asch,
the
civil
governor
of
Smolensk,
1812.)
People
were
anxiously
roaming
about
the
streets.
Carts
piled
high
with
household
utensils,
chairs,
and
cupboards
kept
emerging
from
the
gates
of
the
yards
and
moving
along
the
streets.
Loaded
carts
stood
at
the
house
next
to
Ferapontov's
and
women
were
wailing
and
lamenting
as
they
said
good-by.
A
small
watchdog
ran
round
barking
in
front
of
the
harnessed
horses.
Alpatych
entered
the
innyard
at
a
quicker
pace
than
usual
and
went
straight
to
the
shed
where
his
horses
and
trap
were.
The
coachman
was
asleep.
He
woke
him
up,
told
him
to
harness,
and
went
into
the
passage.
From
the
host's
room
came
the
sounds
of
a
child
crying,
the
despairing
sobs
of
a
woman,
and
the
hoarse
angry
shouting
of
Ferapontov.
The
cook
began
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
passage
like
a
frightened
hen,
just
as
Alpatych
entered.
"He's
done
her
to
death.
Killed
the
mistress!...
Beat
her...
dragged
her
about
so!..."
"What
for?"
asked
Alpatych.
"She
kept
begging
to
go
away.
She's
a
woman!
'Take
me
away,'
says
she,
'don't
let
me
perish
with
my
little
children!
Folks,'
she
says,
'are
all
gone,
so
why,'
she
says,
'don't
we
go?'
And
he
began
beating
and
pulling
her
about
so!"
At
these
words
Alpatych
nodded
as
if
in
approval,
and
not
wishing
to
hear
more
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
opposite
the
innkeeper's,
where
he
had
left
his
purchases.
"You
brute,
you
murderer!"
screamed
a
thin,
pale
woman
who,
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
her
kerchief
torn
from
her
head,
burst
through
the
door
at
that
moment
and
down
the
steps
into
the
yard.
Ferapontov
came
out
after
her,
but
on
seeing
Alpatych
adjusted
his
waistcoat,
smoothed
his
hair,
yawned,
and
followed
Alpatych
into
the
opposite
room.
"Going
already?"
said
he.
Alpatych,
without
answering
or
looking
at
his
host,
sorted
his
packages
and
asked
how
much
he
owed.
"We'll
reckon
up!
Well,
have
you
been
to
the
Governor's?"
asked
Ferapontov.
"What
has
been
decided?"
Alpatych
replied
that
the
Governor
had
not
told
him
anything
definite.
"With
our
business,
how
can
we
get
away?"
said
Ferapontov.
"We'd
have
to
pay
seven
rubles
a
cartload
to
Dorogobuzh
and
I
tell
them
they're
not
Christians
to
ask
it!
Selivanov,
now,
did
a
good
stroke
last
Thursday--
sold
flour
to
the
army
at
nine
rubles
a
sack.
Will
you
have
some
tea?"
he
added.
While
the
horses
were
being
harnessed
Alpatych
and
Ferapontov
over
their
tea
talked
of
the
price
of
corn,
the
crops,
and
the
good
weather
for
harvesting.
"Well,
it
seems
to
be
getting
quieter,"
remarked
Ferapontov,
finishing
his
third
cup
of
tea
and
getting
up.
"Ours
must
have
got
the
best
of
it.
The
orders
were
not
to
let
them
in.
So
we're
in
force,
it
seems....
They
say
the
other
day
Matthew
Ivanych
Platov
drove
them
into
the
river
Marina
and
drowned
some
eighteen
thousand
in
one
day."
Alpatych
collected
his
parcels,
handed
them
to
the
coachman
who
had
come
in,
and
settled
up
with
the
innkeeper.
The
noise
of
wheels,
hoofs,
and
bells
was
heard
from
the
gateway
as
a
little
trap
passed
out.
It
was
by
now
late
in
the
afternoon.
Half
the
street
was
in
shadow,
the
other
half
brightly
lit
by
the
sun.
Alpatych
looked
out
of
the
window
and
went
to
the
door.
Suddenly
the
strange
sound
of
a
far-off
whistling
and
thud
was
heard,
followed
by
a
boom
of
cannon
blending
into
a
dull
roar
that
set
the
windows
rattling.
He
went
out
into
the
street:
two
men
were
running
past
toward
the
bridge.
From
different
sides
came
whistling
sounds
and
the
thud
of
cannon
balls
and
bursting
shells
falling
on
the
town.
But
these
sounds
were
hardly
heard
in
comparison
with
the
noise
of
the
firing
outside
the
town
and
attracted
little
attention
from
the
inhabitants.
The
town
was
being
bombarded
by
a
hundred
and
thirty
guns
which
Napoleon
had
ordered
up
after
four
o'clock.
The
people
did
not
at
once
realize
the
meaning
of
this
bombardment.
At
first
the
noise
of
the
falling
bombs
and
shells
only
aroused
curiosity.
Ferapontov's
wife,
who
till
then
had
not
ceased
wailing
under
the
shed,
became
quiet
and
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
went
to
the
gate,
listening
to
the
sounds
and
looking
in
silence
at
the
people.
The
cook
and
a
shop
assistant
came
to
the
gate.
With
lively
curiosity
everyone
tried
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
projectiles
as
they
flew
over
their
heads.
Several
people
came
round
the
corner
talking
eagerly.
"What
force!"
remarked
one.
"Knocked
the
roof
and
ceiling
all
to
splinters!"
"Routed
up
the
earth
like
a
pig,"
said
another.
"That's
grand,
it
bucks
one
up!"
laughed
the
first.
"Lucky
you
jumped
aside,
or
it
would
have
wiped
you
out!"
Others
joined
those
men
and
stopped
and
told
how
cannon
balls
had
fallen
on
a
house
close
to
them.
Meanwhile
still
more
projectiles,
now
with
the
swift
sinister
whistle
of
a
cannon
ball,
now
with
the
agreeable
intermittent
whistle
of
a
shell,
flew
over
people's
heads
incessantly,
but
not
one
fell
close
by,
they
all
flew
over.
Alpatych
was
getting
into
his
trap.
The
innkeeper
stood
at
the
gate.
"What
are
you
staring
at?"
he
shouted
to
the
cook,
who
in
her
red
skirt,
with
sleeves
rolled
up,
swinging
her
bare
elbows,
had
stepped
to
the
corner
to
listen
to
what
was
being
said.
"What
marvels!"
she
exclaimed,
but
hearing
her
master's
voice
she
turned
back,
pulling
down
her
tucked-up
skirt.
Once
more
something
whistled,
but
this
time
quite
close,
swooping
downwards
like
a
little
bird;
a
flame
flashed
in
the
middle
of
the
street,
something
exploded,
and
the
street
was
shrouded
in
smoke.
"Scoundrel,
what
are
you
doing?"
shouted
the
innkeeper,
rushing
to
the
cook.
At
that
moment
the
pitiful
wailing
of
women
was
heard
from
different
sides,
the
frightened
baby
began
to
cry,
and
people
crowded
silently
with
pale
faces
round
the
cook.
The
loudest
sound
in
that
crowd
was
her
wailing.
"Oh-h-h!
Dear
souls,
dear
kind
souls!
Don't
let
me
die!
My
good
souls!..."
Five
minutes
later
no
one
remained
in
the
street.
The
cook,
with
her
thigh
broken
by
a
shell
splinter,
had
been
carried
into
the
kitchen.
Alpatych,
his
coachman,
Ferapontov's
wife
and
children
and
the
house
porter
were
all
sitting
in
the
cellar,
listening.
The
roar
of
guns,
the
whistling
of
projectiles,
and
the
piteous
moaning
of
the
cook,
which
rose
above
the
other
sounds,
did
not
cease
for
a
moment.
The
mistress
rocked
and
hushed
her
baby
and
when
anyone
came
into
the
cellar
asked
in
a
pathetic
whisper
what
had
become
of
her
husband
who
had
remained
in
the
street.
A
shopman
who
entered
told
her
that
her
husband
had
gone
with
others
to
the
cathedral,
whence
they
were
fetching
the
wonder-
working
icon
of
Smolensk.
Toward
dusk
the
cannonade
began
to
subside.
Alpatych
left
the
cellar
and
stopped
in
the
doorway.
The
evening
sky
that
had
been
so
clear
was
clouded
with
smoke,
through
which,
high
up,
the
sickle
of
the
new
moon
shone
strangely.
Now
that
the
terrible
din
of
the
guns
had
ceased
a
hush
seemed
to
reign
over
the
town,
broken
only
by
the
rustle
of
footsteps,
the
moaning,
the
distant
cries,
and
the
crackle
of
fires
which
seemed
widespread
everywhere.
The
cook's
moans
had
now
subsided.
On
two
sides
black
curling
clouds
of
smoke
rose
and
spread
from
the
fires.
Through
the
streets
soldiers
in
various
uniforms
walked
or
ran
confusedly
in
different
directions
like
ants
from
a
ruined
ant-hill.
Several
of
them
ran
into
Ferapontov's
yard
before
Alpatych's
eyes.
Alpatych
went
out
to
the
gate.
A
retreating
regiment,
thronging
and
hurrying,
blocked
the
street.
Noticing
him,
an
officer
said:
"The
town
is
being
abandoned.
Get
away,
get
away!"
and
then,
turning
to
the
soldiers,
shouted:
"I'll
teach
you
to
run
into
the
yards!"
Alpatych
went
back
to
the
house,
called
the
coachman,
and
told
him
to
set
off.
Ferapontov's
whole
household
came
out
too,
following
Alpatych
and
the
coachman.
The
women,
who
had
been
silent
till
then,
suddenly
began
to
wail
as
they
looked
at
the
fires--the
smoke
and
even
the
flames
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
failing
twilight--and
as
if
in
reply
the
same
kind
of
lamentation
was
heard
from
other
parts
of
the
street.
Inside
the
shed
Alpatych
and
the
coachman
arranged
the
tangled
reins
and
traces
of
their
horses
with
trembling
hands.
As
Alpatych
was
driving
out
of
the
gate
he
saw
some
ten
soldiers
in
Ferapontov's
open
shop,
talking
loudly
and
filling
their
bags
and
knapsacks
with
flour
and
sunflower
seeds.
Just
then
Ferapontov
returned
and
entered
his
shop.
On
seeing
the
soldiers
he
was
about
to
shout
at
them,
but
suddenly
stopped
and,
clutching
at
his
hair,
burst
into
sobs
and
laughter:
"Loot
everything,
lads!
Don't
let
those
devils
get
it!"
he
cried,
taking
some
bags
of
flour
himself
and
throwing
them
into
the
street.
Some
of
the
soldiers
were
frightened
and
ran
away,
others
went
on
filling
their
bags.
On
seeing
Alpatych,
Ferapontov
turned
to
him:
"Russia
is
done
for!"
he
cried.
"Alpatych,
I'll
set
the
place
on
fire
myself.
We're
done
for!..."
and
Ferapontov
ran
into
the
yard.
Soldiers
were
passing
in
a
constant
stream
along
the
street
blocking
it
completely,
so
that
Alpatych
could
not
pass
out
and
had
to
wait.
Ferapontov's
wife
and
children
were
also
sitting
in
a
cart
waiting
till
it
was
possible
to
drive
out.
Night
had
come.
There
were
stars
in
the
sky
and
the
new
moon
shone
out
amid
the
smoke
that
screened
it.
On
the
sloping
descent
to
the
Dnieper
Alpatych's
cart
and
that
of
the
innkeeper's
wife,
which
were
slowly
moving
amid
the
rows
of
soldiers
and
of
other
vehicles,
had
to
stop.
In
a
side
street
near
the
crossroads
where
the
vehicles
had
stopped,
a
house
and
some
shops
were
on
fire.
This
fire
was
already
burning
itself
out.
The
flames
now
died
down
and
were
lost
in
the
black
smoke,
now
suddenly
flared
up
again
brightly,
lighting
up
with
strange
distinctness
the
faces
of
the
people
crowding
at
the
crossroads.
Black
figures
flitted
about
before
the
fire,
and
through
the
incessant
crackling
of
the
flames
talking
and
shouting
could
be
heard.
Seeing
that
his
trap
would
not
be
able
to
move
on
for
some
time,
Alpatych
got
down
and
turned
into
the
side
street
to
look
at
the
fire.
Soldiers
were
continually
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
near
it,
and
he
saw
two
of
them
and
a
man
in
a
frieze
coat
dragging
burning
beams
into
another
yard
across
the
street,
while
others
carried
bundles
of
hay.
Alpatych
went
up
to
a
large
crowd
standing
before
a
high
barn
which
was
blazing
briskly.
The
walls
were
all
on
fire
and
the
back
wall
had
fallen
in,
the
wooden
roof
was
collapsing,
and
the
rafters
were
alight.
The
crowd
was
evidently
watching
for
the
roof
to
fall
in,
and
Alpatych
watched
for
it
too.
"Alpatych!"
a
familiar
voice
suddenly
hailed
the
old
man.
"Mercy
on
us!
Your
excellency!"
answered
Alpatych,
immediately
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
young
prince.
Prince
Andrew
in
his
riding
cloak,
mounted
on
a
black
horse,
was
looking
at
Alpatych
from
the
back
of
the
crowd.
"Why
are
you
here?"
he
asked.
"Your...
your
excellency,"
stammered
Alpatych
and
broke
into
sobs.
"Are
we
really
lost?
Master!..."
"Why
are
you
here?"
Prince
Andrew
repeated.
At
that
moment
the
flames
flared
up
and
showed
his
young
master's
pale
worn
face.
Alpatych
told
how
he
had
been
sent
there
and
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
away.
"Are
we
really
quite
lost,
your
excellency?"
he
asked
again.
Prince
Andrew
without
replying
took
out
a
notebook
and
raising
his
knee
began
writing
in
pencil
on
a
page
he
tore
out.
He
wrote
to
his
sister:
"Smolensk
is
being
abandoned.
Bald
Hills
will
be
occupied
by
the
enemy
within
a
week.
Set
off
immediately
for
Moscow.
Let
me
know
at
once
when
you
will
start.
Send
by
special
messenger
to
Usvyazh."
Having
written
this
and
given
the
paper
to
Alpatych,
he
told
him
how
to
arrange
for
departure
of
the
prince,
the
princess,
his
son,
and
the
boy's
tutor,
and
how
and
where
to
let
him
know
immediately.
Before
he
had
had
time
to
finish
giving
these
instructions,
a
chief
of
staff
followed
by
a
suite
galloped
up
to
him.
"You
are
a
colonel?"
shouted
the
chief
of
staff
with
a
German
accent,
in
a
voice
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew.
"Houses
are
set
on
fire
in
your
presence
and
you
stand
by!
What
does
this
mean?
You
will
answer
for
it!"
shouted
Berg,
who
was
now
assistant
to
the
chief
of
staff
of
the
commander
of
the
left
flank
of
the
infantry
of
the
first
army,
a
place,
as
Berg
said,
"very
agreeable
and
well
en
evidence."
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
him
and
without
replying
went
on
speaking
to
Alpatych.
"So
tell
them
that
I
shall
await
a
reply
till
the
tenth,
and
if
by
the
tenth
I
don't
receive
news
that
they
have
all
got
away
I
shall
have
to
throw
up
everything
and
come
myself
to
Bald
Hills."
"Prince,"
said
Berg,
recognizing
Prince
Andrew,
"I
only
spoke
because
I
have
to
obey
orders,
because
I
always
do
obey
exactly....
You
must
please
excuse
me,"
he
went
on
apologetically.
Something
cracked
in
the
flames.
The
fire
died
down
for
a
moment
and
wreaths
of
black
smoke
rolled
from
under
the
roof.
There
was
another
terrible
crash
and
something
huge
collapsed.
"Ou-rou-rou!"
yelled
the
crowd,
echoing
the
crash
of
the
collapsing
roof
of
the
barn,
the
burning
grain
in
which
diffused
a
cakelike
aroma
all
around.
The
flames
flared
up
again,
lighting
the
animated,
delighted,
exhausted
faces
of
the
spectators.
The
man
in
the
frieze
coat
raised
his
arms
and
shouted:
"It's
fine,
lads!
Now
it's
raging...
It's
fine!"
"That's
the
owner
himself,"
cried
several
voices.
"Well
then,"
continued
Prince
Andrew
to
Alpatych,
"report
to
them
as
I
have
told
you";
and
not
replying
a
word
to
Berg
who
was
now
mute
beside
him,
he
touched
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
side
street.
CHAPTER
V
From
Smolensk
the
troops
continued
to
retreat,
followed
by
the
enemy.
On
the
tenth
of
August
the
regiment
Prince
Andrew
commanded
was
marching
along
the
highroad
past
the
avenue
leading
to
Bald
Hills.
Heat
and
drought
had
continued
for
more
than
three
weeks.
Each
day
fleecy
clouds
floated
across
the
sky
and
occasionally
veiled
the
sun,
but
toward
evening
the
sky
cleared
again
and
the
sun
set
in
reddish-brown
mist.
Heavy
night
dews
alone
refreshed
the
earth.
The
unreaped
corn
was
scorched
and
shed
its
grain.
The
marshes
dried
up.
The
cattle
lowed
from
hunger,
finding
no
food
on
the
sun-parched
meadows.
Only
at
night
and
in
the
forests
while
the
dew
lasted
was
there
any
freshness.
But
on
the
road,
the
highroad
along
which
the
troops
marched,
there
was
no
such
freshness
even
at
night
or
when
the
road
passed
through
the
forest;
the
dew
was
imperceptible
on
the
sandy
dust
churned
up
more
than
six
inches
deep.
As
soon
as
day
dawned
the
march
began.
The
artillery
and
baggage
wagons
moved
noiselessly
through
the
deep
dust
that
rose
to
the
very
hubs
of
the
wheels,
and
the
infantry
sank
ankle-deep
in
that
soft,
choking,
hot
dust
that
never
cooled
even
at
night.
Some
of
this
dust
was
kneaded
by
the
feet
and
wheels,
while
the
rest
rose
and
hung
like
a
cloud
over
the
troops,
settling
in
eyes,
ears,
hair,
and
nostrils,
and
worst
of
all
in
the
lungs
of
the
men
and
beasts
as
they
moved
along
that
road.
The
higher
the
sun
rose
the
higher
rose
that
cloud
of
dust,
and
through
the
screen
of
its
hot
fine
particles
one
could
look
with
naked
eye
at
the
sun,
which
showed
like
a
huge
crimson
ball
in
the
unclouded
sky.
There
was
no
wind,
and
the
men
choked
in
that
motionless
atmosphere.
They
marched
with
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
noses
and
mouths.
When
they
passed
through
a
village
they
all
rushed
to
the
wells
and
fought
for
the
water
and
drank
it
down
to
the
mud.
Prince
Andrew
was
in
command
of
a
regiment,
and
the
management
of
that
regiment,
the
welfare
of
the
men
and
the
necessity
of
receiving
and
giving
orders,
engrossed
him.
The
burning
of
Smolensk
and
its
abandonment
made
an
epoch
in
his
life.
A
novel
feeling
of
anger
against
the
foe
made
him
forget
his
own
sorrow.
He
was
entirely
devoted
to
the
affairs
of
his
regiment
and
was
considerate
and
kind
to
his
men
and
officers.
In
the
regiment
they
called
him
"our
prince,"
were
proud
of
him
and
loved
him.
But
he
was
kind
and
gentle
only
to
those
of
his
regiment,
to
Timokhin
and
the
like--people
quite
new
to
him,
belonging
to
a
different
world
and
who
could
not
know
and
understand
his
past.
As
soon
as
he
came
across
a
former
acquaintance
or
anyone
from
the
staff,
he
bristled
up
immediately
and
grew
spiteful,
ironical,
and
contemptuous.
Everything
that
reminded
him
of
his
past
was
repugnant
to
him,
and
so
in
his
relations
with
that
former
circle
he
confined
himself
to
trying
to
do
his
duty
and
not
to
be
unfair.
In
truth
everything
presented
itself
in
a
dark
and
gloomy
light
to
Prince
Andrew,
especially
after
the
abandonment
of
Smolensk
on
the
sixth
of
August
(he
considered
that
it
could
and
should
have
been
defended)
and
after
his
sick
father
had
had
to
flee
to
Moscow,
abandoning
to
pillage
his
dearly
beloved
Bald
Hills
which
he
had
built
and
peopled.
But
despite
this,
thanks
to
his
regiment,
Prince
Andrew
had
something
to
think
about
entirely
apart
from
general
questions.
Two
days
previously
he
had
received
news
that
his
father,
son,
and
sister
had
left
for
Moscow;
and
though
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
at
Bald
Hills,
Prince
Andrew
with
a
characteristic
desire
to
foment
his
own
grief
decided
that
he
must
ride
there.
He
ordered
his
horse
to
be
saddled
and,
leaving
his
regiment
on
the
march,
rode
to
his
father's
estate
where
he
had
been
born
and
spent
his
childhood.
Riding
past
the
pond
where
there
used
always
to
be
dozens
of
women
chattering
as
they
rinsed
their
linen
or
beat
it
with
wooden
beetles,
Prince
Andrew
noticed
that
there
was
not
a
soul
about
and
that
the
little
washing
wharf,
torn
from
its
place
and
half
submerged,
was
floating
on
its
side
in
the
middle
of
the
pond.
He
rode
to
the
keeper's
lodge.
No
one
at
the
stone
entrance
gates
of
the
drive
and
the
door
stood
open.
Grass
had
already
begun
to
grow
on
the
garden
paths,
and
horses
and
calves
were
straying
in
the
English
park.
Prince
Andrew
rode
up
to
the
hothouse;
some
of
the
glass
panes
were
broken,
and
of
the
trees
in
tubs
some
were
overturned
and
others
dried
up.
He
called
for
Taras
the
gardener,
but
no
one
replied.
Having
gone
round
the
corner
of
the
hothouse
to
the
ornamental
garden,
he
saw
that
the
carved
garden
fence
was
broken
and
branches
of
the
plum
trees
had
been
torn
off
with
the
fruit.
An
old
peasant
whom
Prince
Andrew
in
his
childhood
had
often
seen
at
the
gate
was
sitting
on
a
green
garden
seat,
plaiting
a
bast
shoe.
He
was
deaf
and
did
not
hear
Prince
Andrew
ride
up.
He
was
sitting
on
the
seat
the
old
prince
used
to
like
to
sit
on,
and
beside
him
strips
of
bast
were
hanging
on
the
broken
and
withered
branch
of
a
magnolia.
Prince
Andrew
rode
up
to
the
house.
Several
limes
in
the
old
garden
had
been
cut
down
and
a
piebald
mare
and
her
foal
were
wandering
in
front
of
the
house
among
the
rosebushes.
The
shutters
were
all
closed,
except
at
one
window
which
was
open.
A
little
serf
boy,
seeing
Prince
Andrew,
ran
into
the
house.
Alpatych,
having
sent
his
family
away,
was
alone
at
Bald
Hills
and
was
sitting
indoors
reading
the
Lives
of
the
Saints.
On
hearing
that
Prince
Andrew
had
come,
he
went
out
with
his
spectacles
on
his
nose,
buttoning
his
coat,
and,
hastily
stepping
up,
without
a
word
began
weeping
and
kissing
Prince
Andrew's
knee.
Then,
vexed
at
his
own
weakness,
he
turned
away
and
began
to
report
on
the
position
of
affairs.
Everything
precious
and
valuable
had
been
removed
to
Bogucharovo.
Seventy
quarters
of
grain
had
also
been
carted
away.
The
hay
and
the
spring
corn,
of
which
Alpatych
said
there
had
been
a
remarkable
crop
that
year,
had
been
commandeered
by
the
troops
and
mown
down
while
still
green.
The
peasants
were
ruined;
some
of
them
too
had
gone
to
Bogucharovo,
only
a
few
remained.
Without
waiting
to
hear
him
out,
Prince
Andrew
asked:
"When
did
my
father
and
sister
leave?"
meaning
when
did
they
leave
for
Moscow.
Alpatych,
understanding
the
question
to
refer
to
their
departure
for
Bogucharovo,
replied
that
they
had
left
on
the
seventh
and
again
went
into
details
concerning
the
estate
management,
asking
for
instructions.
"Am
I
to
let
the
troops
have
the
oats,
and
to
take
a
receipt
for
them?
We
have
still
six
hundred
quarters
left,"
he
inquired.
"What
am
I
to
say
to
him?"
thought
Prince
Andrew,
looking
down
on
the
old
man's
bald
head
shining
in
the
sun
and
seeing
by
the
expression
on
his
face
that
the
old
man
himself
understood
how
untimely
such
questions
were
and
only
asked
them
to
allay
his
grief.
"Yes,
let
them
have
it,"
replied
Prince
Andrew.
"If
you
noticed
some
disorder
in
the
garden,"
said
Alpatych,
"it
was
impossible
to
prevent
it.
Three
regiments
have
been
here
and
spent
the
night,
dragoons
mostly.
I
took
down
the
name
and
rank
of
their
commanding
officer,
to
hand
in
a
complaint
about
it."
"Well,
and
what
are
you
going
to
do?
Will
you
stay
here
if
the
enemy
occupies
the
place?"
asked
Prince
Andrew.
Alpatych
turned
his
face
to
Prince
Andrew,
looked
at
him,
and
suddenly
with
a
solemn
gesture
raised
his
arm.
"He
is
my
refuge!
His
will
be
done!"
he
exclaimed.
A
group
of
bareheaded
peasants
was
approaching
across
the
meadow
toward
the
prince.
"Well,
good-by!"
said
Prince
Andrew,
bending
over
to
Alpatych.
"You
must
go
away
too,
take
away
what
you
can
and
tell
the
serfs
to
go
to
the
Ryazan
estate
or
to
the
one
near
Moscow."
Alpatych
clung
to
Prince
Andrew's
leg
and
burst
into
sobs.
Gently
disengaging
himself,
the
prince
spurred
his
horse
and
rode
down
the
avenue
at
a
gallop.
The
old
man
was
still
sitting
in
the
ornamental
garden,
like
a
fly
impassive
on
the
face
of
a
loved
one
who
is
dead,
tapping
the
last
on
which
he
was
making
the
bast
shoe,
and
two
little
girls,
running
out
from
the
hot
house
carrying
in
their
skirts
plums
they
had
plucked
from
the
trees
there,
came
upon
Prince
Andrew.
On
seeing
the
young
master,
the
elder
one
with
frightened
look
clutched
her
younger
companion
by
the
hand
and
hid
with
her
behind
a
birch
tree,
not
stopping
to
pick
up
some
green
plums
they
had
dropped.
Prince
Andrew
turned
away
with
startled
haste,
unwilling
to
let
them
see
that
they
had
been
observed.
He
was
sorry
for
the
pretty
frightened
little
girl,
was
afraid
of
looking
at
her,
and
yet
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
do
so.
A
new
sensation
of
comfort
and
relief
came
over
him
when,
seeing
these
girls,
he
realized
the
existence
of
other
human
interests
entirely
aloof
from
his
own
and
just
as
legitimate
as
those
that
occupied
him.
Evidently
these
girls
passionately
desired
one
thing-
-to
carry
away
and
eat
those
green
plums
without
being
caught--and
Prince
Andrew
shared
their
wish
for
the
success
of
their
enterprise.
He
could
not
resist
looking
at
them
once
more.
Believing
their
danger
past,
they
sprang
from
their
ambush
and,
chirruping
something
in
their
shrill
little
voices
and
holding
up
their
skirts,
their
bare
little
sunburned
feet
scampered
merrily
and
quickly
across
the
meadow
grass.
Prince
Andrew
was
somewhat
refreshed
by
having
ridden
off
the
dusty
highroad
along
which
the
troops
were
moving.
But
not
far
from
Bald
Hills
he
again
came
out
on
the
road
and
overtook
his
regiment
at
its
halting
place
by
the
dam
of
a
small
pond.
It
was
past
one
o'clock.
The
sun,
a
red
ball
through
the
dust,
burned
and
scorched
his
back
intolerably
through
his
black
coat.
The
dust
always
hung
motionless
above
the
buzz
of
talk
that
came
from
the
resting
troops.
There
was
no
wind.
As
he
crossed
the
dam
Prince
Andrew
smelled
the
ooze
and
freshness
of
the
pond.
He
longed
to
get
into
that
water,
however
dirty
it
might
be,
and
he
glanced
round
at
the
pool
from
whence
came
sounds
of
shrieks
and
laughter.
The
small,
muddy,
green
pond
had
risen
visibly
more
than
a
foot,
flooding
the
dam,
because
it
was
full
of
the
naked
white
bodies
of
soldiers
with
brick-red
hands,
necks,
and
faces,
who
were
splashing
about
in
it.
All
this
naked
white
human
flesh,
laughing
and
shrieking,
floundered
about
in
that
dirty
pool
like
carp
stuffed
into
a
watering
can,
and
the
suggestion
of
merriment
in
that
floundering
mass
rendered
it
specially
pathetic.
One
fair-haired
young
soldier
of
the
third
company,
whom
Prince
Andrew
knew
and
who
had
a
strap
round
the
calf
of
one
leg,
crossed
himself,
stepped
back
to
get
a
good
run,
and
plunged
into
the
water;
another,
a
dark
noncommissioned
officer
who
was
always
shaggy,
stood
up
to
his
waist
in
the
water
joyfully
wriggling
his
muscular
figure
and
snorted
with
satisfaction
as
he
poured
the
water
over
his
head
with
hands
blackened
to
the
wrists.
There
were
sounds
of
men
slapping
one
another,
yelling,
and
puffing.
Everywhere
on
the
bank,
on
the
dam,
and
in
the
pond,
there
was
healthy,
white,
muscular
flesh.
The
officer,
Timokhin,
with
his
red
little
nose,
standing
on
the
dam
wiping
himself
with
a
towel,
felt
confused
at
seeing
the
prince,
but
made
up
his
mind
to
address
him
nevertheless.
"It's
very
nice,
your
excellency!
Wouldn't
you
like
to?"
said
he.
"It's
dirty,"
replied
Prince
Andrew,
making
a
grimace.
"We'll
clear
it
out
for
you
in
a
minute,"
said
Timokhin,
and,
still
undressed,
ran
off
to
clear
the
men
out
of
the
pond.
"The
prince
wants
to
bathe."
"What
prince?
Ours?"
said
many
voices,
and
the
men
were
in
such
haste
to
clear
out
that
the
prince
could
hardly
stop
them.
He
decided
that
he
would
rather
wash
himself
with
water
in
the
barn.
"Flesh,
bodies,
cannon
fodder!"
he
thought,
and
he
looked
at
his
own
naked
body
and
shuddered,
not
from
cold
but
from
a
sense
of
disgust
and
horror
he
did
not
himself
understand,
aroused
by
the
sight
of
that
immense
number
of
bodies
splashing
about
in
the
dirty
pond.
On
the
seventh
of
August
Prince
Bagration
wrote
as
follows
from
his
quarters
at
Mikhaylovna
on
the
Smolensk
road:
Dear
Count
Alexis
Andreevich--(He
was
writing
to
Arakcheev
but
knew
that
his
letter
would
be
read
by
the
Emperor,
and
therefore
weighed
every
word
in
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability.)
I
expect
the
Minister
(Barclay
de
Tolly)
has
already
reported
the
abandonment
of
Smolensk
to
the
enemy.
It
is
pitiable
and
sad,
and
the
whole
army
is
in
despair
that
this
most
important
place
has
been
wantonly
abandoned.
I,
for
my
part,
begged
him
personally
most
urgently
and
finally
wrote
him,
but
nothing
would
induce
him
to
consent.
I
swear
to
you
on
my
honor
that
Napoleon
was
in
such
a
fix
as
never
before
and
might
have
lost
half
his
army
but
could
not
have
taken
Smolensk.
Our
troops
fought,
and
are
fighting,
as
never
before.
With
fifteen
thousand
men
I
held
the
enemy
at
bay
for
thirty-five
hours
and
beat
him;
but
he
would
not
hold
out
even
for
fourteen
hours.
It
is
disgraceful,
a
stain
on
our
army,
and
as
for
him,
he
ought,
it
seems
to
me,
not
to
live.
If
he
reports
that
our
losses
were
great,
it
is
not
true;
perhaps
about
four
thousand,
not
more,
and
not
even
that;
but
even
were
they
ten
thousand,
that's
war!
But
the
enemy
has
lost
masses...
What
would
it
have
cost
him
to
hold
out
for
another
two
days?
They
would
have
had
to
retire
of
their
own
accord,
for
they
had
no
water
for
men
or
horses.
He
gave
me
his
word
he
would
not
retreat,
but
suddenly
sent
instructions
that
he
was
retiring
that
night.
We
cannot
fight
in
this
way,
or
we
may
soon
bring
the
enemy
to
Moscow...
There
is
a
rumor
that
you
are
thinking
of
peace.
God
forbid
that
you
should
make
peace
after
all
our
sacrifices
and
such
insane
retreats!
You
would
set
all
Russia
against
you
and
every
one
of
us
would
feel
ashamed
to
wear
the
uniform.
If
it
has
come
to
this--we
must
fight
as
long
as
Russia
can
and
as
long
as
there
are
men
able
to
stand...
One
man
ought
to
be
in
command,
and
not
two.
Your
Minister
may
perhaps
be
good
as
a
Minister,
but
as
a
general
he
is
not
merely
bad
but
execrable,
yet
to
him
is
entrusted
the
fate
of
our
whole
country....
I
am
really
frantic
with
vexation;
forgive
my
writing
boldly.
It
is
clear
that
the
man
who
advocates
the
conclusion
of
a
peace,
and
that
the
Minister
should
command
the
army,
does
not
love
our
sovereign
and
desires
the
ruin
of
us
all.
So
I
write
you
frankly:
call
out
the
militia.
For
the
Minister
is
leading
these
visitors
after
him
to
Moscow
in
a
most
masterly
way.
The
whole
army
feels
great
suspicion
of
the
Imperial
aide-de-camp
Wolzogen.
He
is
said
to
be
more
Napoleon's
man
than
ours,
and
he
is
always
advising
the
Minister.
I
am
not
merely
civil
to
him
but
obey
him
like
a
corporal,
though
I
am
his
senior.
This
is
painful,
but,
loving
my
benefactor
and
sovereign,
I
submit.
Only
I
am
sorry
for
the
Emperor
that
he
entrusts
our
fine
army
to
such
as
he.
Consider
that
on
our
retreat
we
have
lost
by
fatigue
and
left
in
the
hospital
more
than
fifteen
thousand
men,
and
had
we
attacked
this
would
not
have
happened.
Tell
me,
for
God's
sake,
what
will
Russia,
our
mother
Russia,
say
to
our
being
so
frightened,
and
why
are
we
abandoning
our
good
and
gallant
Fatherland
to
such
rabble
and
implanting
feelings
of
hatred
and
shame
in
all
our
subjects?
What
are
we
scared
at
and
of
whom
are
we
afraid?
I
am
not
to
blame
that
the
Minister
is
vacillating,
a
coward,
dense,
dilatory,
and
has
all
bad
qualities.
The
whole
army
bewails
it
and
calls
down
curses
upon
him...
CHAPTER
VI
Among
the
innumerable
categories
applicable
to
the
phenomena
of
human
life
one
may
discriminate
between
those
in
which
substance
prevails
and
those
in
which
form
prevails.
To
the
latter--as
distinguished
from
village,
country,
provincial,
or
even
Moscow
life--we
may
allot
Petersburg
life,
and
especially
the
life
of
its
salons.
That
life
of
the
salons
is
unchanging.
Since
the
year
1805
we
had
made
peace
and
had
again
quarreled
with
Bonaparte
and
had
made
constitutions
and
unmade
them
again,
but
the
salons
of
Anna
Pavlovna
and
Helene
remained
just
as
they
had
been--the
one
seven
and
the
other
five
years
before.
At
Anna
Pavlovna's
they
talked
with
perplexity
of
Bonaparte's
successes
just
as
before
and
saw
in
them
and
in
the
subservience
shown
to
him
by
the
European
sovereigns
a
malicious
conspiracy,
the
sole
object
of
which
was
to
cause
unpleasantness
and
anxiety
to
the
court
circle
of
which
Anna
Pavlovna
was
the
representative.
And
in
Helene's
salon,
which
Rumyantsev
himself
honored
with
his
visits,
regarding
Helene
as
a
remarkably
intelligent
woman,
they
talked
with
the
same
ecstasy
in
1812
as
in
1808
of
the
"great
nation"
and
the
"great
man,"
and
regretted
our
rupture
with
France,
a
rupture
which,
according
to
them,
ought
to
be
promptly
terminated
by
peace.
Of
late,
since
the
Emperor's
return
from
the
army,
there
had
been
some
excitement
in
these
conflicting
salon
circles
and
some
demonstrations
of
hostility
to
one
another,
but
each
camp
retained
its
own
tendency.
In
Anna
Pavlovna's
circle
only
those
Frenchmen
were
admitted
who
were
deep-
rooted
legitimists,
and
patriotic
views
were
expressed
to
the
effect
that
one
ought
not
to
go
to
the
French
theater
and
that
to
maintain
the
French
troupe
was
costing
the
government
as
much
as
a
whole
army
corps.
The
progress
of
the
war
was
eagerly
followed,
and
only
the
reports
most
flattering
to
our
army
were
circulated.
In
the
French
circle
of
Helene
and
Rumyantsev
the
reports
of
the
cruelty
of
the
enemy
and
of
the
war
were
contradicted
and
all
Napoleon's
attempts
at
conciliation
were
discussed.
In
that
circle
they
discountenanced
those
who
advised
hurried
preparations
for
a
removal
to
Kazan
of
the
court
and
the
girls'
educational
establishments
under
the
patronage
of
the
Dowager
Empress.
In
Helene's
circle
the
war
in
general
was
regarded
as
a
series
of
formal
demonstrations
which
would
very
soon
end
in
peace,
and
the
view
prevailed
expressed
by
Bilibin--who
now
in
Petersburg
was
quite
at
home
in
Helene's
house,
which
every
clever
man
was
obliged
to
visit--that
not
by
gunpowder
but
by
those
who
invented
it
would
matters
be
settled.
In
that
circle
the
Moscow
enthusiasm--news
of
which
had
reached
Petersburg
simultaneously
with
the
Emperor's
return--was
ridiculed
sarcastically
and
very
cleverly,
though
with
much
caution.
Anna
Pavlovna's
circle
on
the
contrary
was
enraptured
by
this
enthusiasm
and
spoke
of
it
as
Plutarch
speaks
of
the
deeds
of
the
ancients.
Prince
Vasili,
who
still
occupied
his
former
important
posts,
formed
a
connecting
link
between
these
two
circles.
He
visited
his
"good
friend
Anna
Pavlovna"
as
well
as
his
daughter's
"diplomatic
salon,"
and
often
in
his
constant
comings
and
goings
between
the
two
camps
became
confused
and
said
at
Helene's
what
he
should
have
said
at
Anna
Pavlovna's
and
vice
versa.
Soon
after
the
Emperor's
return
Prince
Vasili
in
a
conversation
about
the
war
at
Anna
Pavlovna's
severely
condemned
Barclay
de
Tolly,
but
was
undecided
as
to
who
ought
to
be
appointed
commander-in-chief.
One
of
the
visitors,
usually
spoken
of
as
"a
man
of
great
merit,"
having
described
how
he
had
that
day
seen
Kutuzov,
the
newly
chosen
chief
of
the
Petersburg
militia,
presiding
over
the
enrollment
of
recruits
at
the
Treasury,
cautiously
ventured
to
suggest
that
Kutuzov
would
be
the
man
to
satisfy
all
requirements.
Anna
Pavlovna
remarked
with
a
melancholy
smile
that
Kutuzov
had
done
nothing
but
cause
the
Emperor
annoyance.
"I
have
talked
and
talked
at
the
Assembly
of
the
Nobility,"
Prince
Vasili
interrupted,
"but
they
did
not
listen
to
me.
I
told
them
his
election
as
chief
of
the
militia
would
not
please
the
Emperor.
They
did
not
listen
to
me.
"It's
all
this
mania
for
opposition,"
he
went
on.
"And
who
for?
It
is
all
because
we
want
to
ape
the
foolish
enthusiasm
of
those
Muscovites,"
Prince
Vasili
continued,
forgetting
for
a
moment
that
though
at
Helene's
one
had
to
ridicule
the
Moscow
enthusiasm,
at
Anna
Pavlovna's
one
had
to
be
ecstatic
about
it.
But
he
retrieved
his
mistake
at
once.
"Now,
is
it
suitable
that
Count
Kutuzov,
the
oldest
general
in
Russia,
should
preside
at
that
tribunal?
He
will
get
nothing
for
his
pains!
How
could
they
make
a
man
commander-in-chief
who
cannot
mount
a
horse,
who
drops
asleep
at
a
council,
and
has
the
very
worst
morals!
A
good
reputation
he
made
for
himself
at
Bucharest!
I
don't
speak
of
his
capacity
as
a
general,
but
at
a
time
like
this
how
they
appoint
a
decrepit,
blind
old
man,
positively
blind?
A
fine
idea
to
have
a
blind
general!
He
can't
see
anything.
To
play
blindman's
bluff?
He
can't
see
at
all!"
No
one
replied
to
his
remarks.
This
was
quite
correct
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
July.
But
on
the
twenty-
ninth
of
July
Kutuzov
received
the
title
of
Prince.
This
might
indicate
a
wish
to
get
rid
of
him,
and
therefore
Prince
Vasili's
opinion
continued
to
be
correct
though
he
was
not
now
in
any
hurry
to
express
it.
But
on
the
eighth
of
August
a
committee,
consisting
of
Field
Marshal
Saltykov,
Arakcheev,
Vyazmitinov,
Lopukhin,
and
Kochubey
met
to
consider
the
progress
of
the
war.
This
committee
came
to
the
conclusion
that
our
failures
were
due
to
a
want
of
unity
in
the
command
and
though
the
members
of
the
committee
were
aware
of
the
Emperor's
dislike
of
Kutuzov,
after
a
short
deliberation
they
agreed
to
advise
his
appointment
as
commander
in
chief.
That
same
day
Kutuzov
was
appointed
commander-in-
chief
with
full
powers
over
the
armies
and
over
the
whole
region
occupied
by
them.
On
the
ninth
of
August
Prince
Vasili
at
Anna
Pavlovna's
again
met
the
"man
of
great
merit."
The
latter
was
very
attentive
to
Anna
Pavlovna
because
he
wanted
to
be
appointed
director
of
one
of
the
educational
establishments
for
young
ladies.
Prince
Vasili
entered
the
room
with
the
air
of
a
happy
conqueror
who
has
attained
the
object
of
his
desires.
"Well,
have
you
heard
the
great
news?
Prince
Kutuzov
is
field
marshal!
All
dissensions
are
at
an
end!
I
am
so
glad,
so
delighted!
At
last
we
have
a
man!"
said
he,
glancing
sternly
and
significantly
round
at
everyone
in
the
drawing
room.
The
"man
of
great
merit,"
despite
his
desire
to
obtain
the
post
of
director,
could
not
refrain
from
reminding
Prince
Vasili
of
his
former
opinion.
Though
this
was
impolite
to
Prince
Vasili
in
Anna
Pavlovna's
drawing
room,
and
also
to
Anna
Pavlovna
herself
who
had
received
the
news
with
delight,
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation.
"But,
Prince,
they
say
he
is
blind!"
said
he,
reminding
Prince
Vasili
of
his
own
words.
"Eh?
Nonsense!
He
sees
well
enough,"
said
Prince
Vasili
rapidly,
in
a
deep
voice
and
with
a
slight
cough--the
voice
and
cough
with
which
he
was
wont
to
dispose
of
all
difficulties.
"He
sees
well
enough,"
he
added.
"And
what
I
am
so
pleased
about,"
he
went
on,
"is
that
our
sovereign
has
given
him
full
powers
over
all
the
armies
and
the
whole
region--powers
no
commander-in-chief
ever
had
before.
He
is
a
second
autocrat,"
he
concluded
with
a
victorious
smile.
"God
grant
it!
God
grant
it!"
said
Anna
Pavlovna.
The
"man
of
great
merit,"
who
was
still
a
novice
in
court
circles,
wishing
to
flatter
Anna
Pavlovna
by
defending
her
former
position
on
this
question,
observed:
"It
is
said
that
the
Emperor
was
reluctant
to
give
Kutuzov
those
powers.
They
say
he
blushed
like
a
girl
to
whom
Joconde
is
read,
when
he
said
to
Kutuzov:
'Your
Emperor
and
the
Fatherland
award
you
this
honor.'"
"Perhaps
the
heart
took
no
part
in
that
speech,"
said
Anna
Pavlovna.
"Oh,
no,
no!"
warmly
rejoined
Prince
Vasili,
who
would
not
now
yield
Kutuzov
to
anyone;
in
his
opinion
Kutuzov
was
not
only
admirable
himself,
but
was
adored
by
everybody.
"No,
that's
impossible,"
said
he,
"for
our
sovereign
appreciated
him
so
highly
before."
"God
grant
only
that
Prince
Kutuzov
assumes
real
power
and
does
not
allow
anyone
to
put
a
spoke
in
his
wheel,"
observed
Anna
Pavlovna.
Understanding
at
once
to
whom
she
alluded,
Prince
Vasili
said
in
a
whisper:
"I
know
for
a
fact
that
Kutuzov
made
it
an
absolute
condition
that
the
Tsarevich
should
not
be
with
the
army.
Do
you
know
what
he
said
to
the
Emperor?"
And
Prince
Vasili
repeated
the
words
supposed
to
have
been
spoken
by
Kutuzov
to
the
Emperor.
"I
can
neither
punish
him
if
he
does
wrong
nor
reward
him
if
he
does
right."
"Oh,
a
very
wise
man
is
Prince
Kutuzov!
I
have
known
him
a
long
time!"
"They
even
say,"
remarked
the
"man
of
great
merit"
who
did
not
yet
possess
courtly
tact,
"that
his
excellency
made
it
an
express
condition
that
the
sovereign
himself
should
not
be
with
the
army."
As
soon
as
he
said
this
both
Prince
Vasili
and
Anna
Pavlovna
turned
away
from
him
and
glanced
sadly
at
one
another
with
a
sigh
at
his
naivete.
CHAPTER
VII
While
this
was
taking
place
in
Petersburg
the
French
had
already
passed
Smolensk
and
were
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
Moscow.
Napoleon's
historian
Thiers,
like
other
of
his
historians,
trying
to
justify
his
hero
says
that
he
was
drawn
to
the
walls
of
Moscow
against
his
will.
He
is
as
right
as
other
historians
who
look
for
the
explanation
of
historic
events
in
the
will
of
one
man;
he
is
as
right
as
the
Russian
historians
who
maintain
that
Napoleon
was
drawn
to
Moscow
by
the
skill
of
the
Russian
commanders.
Here
besides
the
law
of
retrospection,
which
regards
all
the
past
as
a
preparation
for
events
that
subsequently
occur,
the
law
of
reciprocity
comes
in,
confusing
the
whole
matter.
A
good
chessplayer
having
lost
a
game
is
sincerely
convinced
that
his
loss
resulted
from
a
mistake
he
made
and
looks
for
that
mistake
in
the
opening,
but
forgets
that
at
each
stage
of
the
game
there
were
similar
mistakes
and
that
none
of
his
moves
were
perfect.
He
only
notices
the
mistake
to
which
he
pays
attention,
because
his
opponent
took
advantage
of
it.
How
much
more
complex
than
this
is
the
game
of
war,
which
occurs
under
certain
limits
of
time,
and
where
it
is
not
one
will
that
manipulates
lifeless
objects,
but
everything
results
from
innumerable
conflicts
of
various
wills!
After
Smolensk
Napoleon
sought
a
battle
beyond
Dorogobuzh
at
Vyazma,
and
then
at
Tsarevo-Zaymishche,
but
it
happened
that
owing
to
a
conjunction
of
innumerable
circumstances
the
Russians
could
not
give
battle
till
they
reached
Borodino,
seventy
miles
from
Moscow.
From
Vyazma
Napoleon
ordered
a
direct
advance
on
Moscow.
Moscou,
la
capitale
asiatique
de
ce
grand
empire,
la
ville
sacree
des
peuples
d'Alexandre,
Moscou
avec
ses
innombrables
eglises
en
forme
de
pagodes
chinoises,
*
this
Moscow
gave
Napoleon's
imagination
no
rest.
On
the
march
from
Vyazma
to
Tsarevo-Zaymishche
he
rode
his
light
bay
bobtailed
ambler
accompanied
by
his
Guards,
his
bodyguard,
his
pages,
and
aides-de-camp.
Berthier,
his
chief
of
staff,
dropped
behind
to
question
a
Russian
prisoner
captured
by
the
cavalry.
Followed
by
Lelorgne
d'Ideville,
an
interpreter,
he
overtook
Napoleon
at
a
gallop
and
reined
in
his
horse
with
an
amused
expression.
*
"Moscow,
the
Asiatic
capital
of
this
great
empire,
the
sacred
city
of
Alexander's
people,
Moscow
with
its
innumerable
churches
shaped
like
Chinese
pagodas."
"Well?"
asked
Napoleon.
"One
of
Platov's
Cossacks
says
that
Platov's
corps
is
joining
up
with
the
main
army
and
that
Kutuzov
has
been
appointed
commander-in-chief.
He
is
a
very
shrewd
and
garrulous
fellow."
Napoleon
smiled
and
told
them
to
give
the
Cossack
a
horse
and
bring
the
man
to
him.
He
wished
to
talk
to
him
himself.
Several
adjutants
galloped
off,
and
an
hour
later,
Lavrushka,
the
serf
Denisov
had
handed
over
to
Rostov,
rode
up
to
Napoleon
in
an
orderly's
jacket
and
on
a
French
cavalry
saddle,
with
a
merry,
and
tipsy
face.
Napoleon
told
him
to
ride
by
his
side
and
began
questioning
him.
"You
are
a
Cossack?"
"Yes,
a
Cossack,
your
Honor."
"The
Cossack,
not
knowing
in
what
company
he
was,
for
Napoleon's
plain
appearance
had
nothing
about
it
that
would
reveal
to
an
Oriental
mind
the
presence
of
a
monarch,
talked
with
extreme
familiarity
of
the
incidents
of
the
war,"
says
Thiers,
narrating
this
episode.
In
reality
Lavrushka,
having
got
drunk
the
day
before
and
left
his
master
dinnerless,
had
been
whipped
and
sent
to
the
village
in
quest
of
chickens,
where
he
engaged
in
looting
till
the
French
took
him
prisoner.
Lavrushka
was
one
of
those
coarse,
bare-faced
lackeys
who
have
seen
all
sorts
of
things,
consider
it
necessary
to
do
everything
in
a
mean
and
cunning
way,
are
ready
to
render
any
sort
of
service
to
their
master,
and
are
keen
at
guessing
their
master's
baser
impulses,
especially
those
prompted
by
vanity
and
pettiness.
Finding
himself
in
the
company
of
Napoleon,
whose
identity
he
had
easily
and
surely
recognized,
Lavrushka
was
not
in
the
least
abashed
but
merely
did
his
utmost
to
gain
his
new
master's
favor.
He
knew
very
well
that
this
was
Napoleon,
but
Napoleon's
presence
could
no
more
intimidate
him
than
Rostov's,
or
a
sergeant
major's
with
the
rods,
would
have
done,
for
he
had
nothing
that
either
the
sergeant
major
or
Napoleon
could
deprive
him
of.
So
he
rattled
on,
telling
all
the
gossip
he
had
heard
among
the
orderlies.
Much
of
it
true.
But
when
Napoleon
asked
him
whether
the
Russians
thought
they
would
beat
Bonaparte
or
not,
Lavrushka
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
considered.
In
this
question
he
saw
subtle
cunning,
as
men
of
his
type
see
cunning
in
everything,
so
he
frowned
and
did
not
answer
immediately.
"It's
like
this,"
he
said
thoughtfully,
"if
there's
a
battle
soon,
yours
will
win.
That's
right.
But
if
three
days
pass,
then
after
that,
well,
then
that
same
battle
will
not
soon
be
over."
Lelorgne
d'Ideville
smilingly
interpreted
this
speech
to
Napoleon
thus:
"If
a
battle
takes
place
within
the
next
three
days
the
French
will
win,
but
if
later,
God
knows
what
will
happen."
Napoleon
did
not
smile,
though
he
was
evidently
in
high
good
humor,
and
he
ordered
these
words
to
be
repeated.
Lavrushka
noticed
this
and
to
entertain
him
further,
pretending
not
to
know
who
Napoleon
was,
added:
"We
know
that
you
have
Bonaparte
and
that
he
has
beaten
everybody
in
the
world,
but
we
are
a
different
matter..."--without
knowing
why
or
how
this
bit
of
boastful
patriotism
slipped
out
at
the
end.
The
interpreter
translated
these
words
without
the
last
phrase,
and
Bonaparte
smiled.
"The
young
Cossack
made
his
mighty
interlocutor
smile,"
says
Thiers.
After
riding
a
few
paces
in
silence,
Napoleon
turned
to
Berthier
and
said
he
wished
to
see
how
the
news
that
he
was
talking
to
the
Emperor
himself,
to
that
very
Emperor
who
had
written
his
immortally
victorious
name
on
the
Pyramids,
would
affect
this
enfant
du
Don.
*
*
"Child
of
the
Don."
The
fact
was
accordingly
conveyed
to
Lavrushka.
Lavrushka,
understanding
that
this
was
done
to
perplex
him
and
that
Napoleon
expected
him
to
be
frightened,
to
gratify
his
new
masters
promptly
pretended
to
be
astonished
and
awe-struck,
opened
his
eyes
wide,
and
assumed
the
expression
he
usually
put
on
when
taken
to
be
whipped.
"As
soon
as
Napoleon's
interpreter
had
spoken,"
says
Thiers,
"the
Cossack,
seized
by
amazement,
did
not
utter
another
word,
but
rode
on,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
conqueror
whose
fame
had
reached
him
across
the
steppes
of
the
East.
All
his
loquacity
was
suddenly
arrested
and
replaced
by
a
naive
and
silent
feeling
of
admiration.
Napoleon,
after
making
the
Cossack
a
present,
had
him
set
free
like
a
bird
restored
to
its
native
fields."
Napoleon
rode
on,
dreaming
of
the
Moscow
that
so
appealed
to
his
imagination,
and
"the
bird
restored
to
its
native
fields"
galloped
to
our
outposts,
inventing
on
the
way
all
that
had
not
taken
place
but
that
he
meant
to
relate
to
his
comrades.
What
had
really
taken
place
he
did
not
wish
to
relate
because
it
seemed
to
him
not
worth
telling.
He
found
the
Cossacks,
inquired
for
the
regiment
operating
with
Platov's
detachment
and
by
evening
found
his
master,
Nicholas
Rostov,
quartered
at
Yankovo.
Rostov
was
just
mounting
to
go
for
a
ride
round
the
neighboring
villages
with
Ilyin;
he
let
Lavrushka
have
another
horse
and
took
him
along
with
him.
CHAPTER
VIII
Princess
Mary
was
not
in
Moscow
and
out
of
danger
as
Prince
Andrew
supposed.
After
the
return
of
Alpatych
from
Smolensk
the
old
prince
suddenly
seemed
to
awake
as
from
a
dream.
He
ordered
the
militiamen
to
be
called
up
from
the
villages
and
armed,
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
commander-in-
chief
informing
him
that
he
had
resolved
to
remain
at
Bald
Hills
to
the
last
extremity
and
to
defend
it,
leaving
to
the
commander-in-chief's
discretion
to
take
measures
or
not
for
the
defense
of
Bald
Hills,
where
one
of
Russia's
oldest
generals
would
be
captured
or
killed,
and
he
announced
to
his
household
that
he
would
remain
at
Bald
Hills.
But
while
himself
remaining,
he
gave
instructions
for
the
departure
of
the
princess
and
Dessalles
with
the
little
prince
to
Bogucharovo
and
thence
to
Moscow.
Princess
Mary,
alarmed
by
her
father's
feverish
and
sleepless
activity
after
his
previous
apathy,
could
not
bring
herself
to
leave
him
alone
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
ventured
to
disobey
him.
She
refused
to
go
away
and
her
father's
fury
broke
over
her
in
a
terrible
storm.
He
repeated
every
injustice
he
had
ever
inflicted
on
her.
Trying
to
convict
her,
he
told
her
she
had
worn
him
out,
had
caused
his
quarrel
with
his
son,
had
harbored
nasty
suspicions
of
him,
making
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
poison
his
existence,
and
he
drove
her
from
his
study
telling
her
that
if
she
did
not
go
away
it
was
all
the
same
to
him.
He
declared
that
he
did
not
wish
to
remember
her
existence
and
warned
her
not
to
dare
to
let
him
see
her.
The
fact
that
he
did
not,
as
she
had
feared,
order
her
to
be
carried
away
by
force
but
only
told
her
not
to
let
him
see
her
cheered
Princess
Mary.
She
knew
it
was
a
proof
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
he
was
glad
she
was
remaining
at
home
and
had
not
gone
away.
The
morning
after
little
Nicholas
had
left,
the
old
prince
donned
his
full
uniform
and
prepared
to
visit
the
commander-in-chief.
His
caleche
was
already
at
the
door.
Princess
Mary
saw
him
walk
out
of
the
house
in
his
uniform
wearing
all
his
orders
and
go
down
the
garden
to
review
his
armed
peasants
and
domestic
serfs.
She
sat
by
the
window
listening
to
his
voice
which
reached
her
from
the
garden.
Suddenly
several
men
came
running
up
the
avenue
with
frightened
faces.
Princess
Mary
ran
out
to
the
porch,
down
the
flower-bordered
path,
and
into
the
avenue.
A
large
crowd
of
militiamen
and
domestics
were
moving
toward
her,
and
in
their
midst
several
men
were
supporting
by
the
armpits
and
dragging
along
a
little
old
man
in
a
uniform
and
decorations.
She
ran
up
to
him
and,
in
the
play
of
the
sunlight
that
fell
in
small
round
spots
through
the
shade
of
the
lime-tree
avenue,
could
not
be
sure
what
change
there
was
in
his
face.
All
she
could
see
was
that
his
former
stern
and
determined
expression
had
altered
to
one
of
timidity
and
submission.
On
seeing
his
daughter
he
moved
his
helpless
lips
and
made
a
hoarse
sound.
It
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
wanted.
He
was
lifted
up,
carried
to
his
study,
and
laid
on
the
very
couch
he
had
so
feared
of
late.
The
doctor,
who
was
fetched
that
same
night,
bled
him
and
said
that
the
prince
had
had
a
seizure
paralyzing
his
right
side.
It
was
becoming
more
and
more
dangerous
to
remain
at
Bald
Hills,
and
next
day
they
moved
the
prince
to
Bogucharovo,
the
doctor
accompanying
him.
By
the
time
they
reached
Bogucharovo,
Dessalles
and
the
little
prince
had
already
left
for
Moscow.
For
three
weeks
the
old
prince
lay
stricken
by
paralysis
in
the
new
house
Prince
Andrew
had
built
at
Bogucharovo,
ever
in
the
same
state,
getting
neither
better
nor
worse.
He
was
unconscious
and
lay
like
a
distorted
corpse.
He
muttered
unceasingly,
his
eyebrows
and
lips
twitching,
and
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
he
understood
what
was
going
on
around
him
or
not.
One
thing
was
certain--that
he
was
suffering
and
wished
to
say
something.
But
what
it
was,
no
one
could
tell:
it
might
be
some
caprice
of
a
sick
and
half-crazy
man,
or
it
might
relate
to
public
affairs,
or
possibly
to
family
concerns.
The
doctor
said
this
restlessness
did
not
mean
anything
and
was
due
to
physical
causes;
but
Princess
Mary
thought
he
wished
to
tell
her
something,
and
the
fact
that
her
presence
always
increased
his
restlessness
confirmed
her
opinion.
He
was
evidently
suffering
both
physically
and
mentally.
There
was
no
hope
of
recovery.
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
travel,
it
would
not
do
to
let
him
die
on
the
road.
"Would
it
not
be
better
if
the
end
did
come,
the
very
end?"
Princess
Mary
sometimes
thought.
Night
and
day,
hardly
sleeping
at
all,
she
watched
him
and,
terrible
to
say,
often
watched
him
not
with
hope
of
finding
signs
of
improvement
but
wishing
to
find
symptoms
of
the
approach
of
the
end.
Strange
as
it
was
to
her
to
acknowledge
this
feeling
in
herself,
yet
there
it
was.
And
what
seemed
still
more
terrible
to
her
was
that
since
her
father's
illness
began
(perhaps
even
sooner,
when
she
stayed
with
him
expecting
something
to
happen),
all
the
personal
desires
and
hopes
that
had
been
forgotten
or
sleeping
within
her
had
awakened.
Thoughts
that
had
not
entered
her
mind
for
years--thoughts
of
a
life
free
from
the
fear
of
her
father,
and
even
the
possibility
of
love
and
of
family
happiness--floated
continually
in
her
imagination
like
temptations
of
the
devil.
Thrust
them
aside
as
she
would,
questions
continually
recurred
to
her
as
to
how
she
would
order
her
life
now,
after
that.
These
were
temptations
of
the
devil
and
Princess
Mary
knew
it.
She
knew
that
the
sole
weapon
against
him
was
prayer,
and
she
tried
to
pray.
She
assumed
an
attitude
of
prayer,
looked
at
the
icons,
repeated
the
words
of
a
prayer,
but
she
could
not
pray.
She
felt
that
a
different
world
had
now
taken
possession
of
her--the
life
of
a
world
of
strenuous
and
free
activity,
quite
opposed
to
the
spiritual
world
in
which
till
now
she
had
been
confined
and
in
which
her
greatest
comfort
had
been
prayer.
She
could
not
pray,
could
not
weep,
and
worldly
cares
took
possession
of
her.
It
was
becoming
dangerous
to
remain
in
Bogucharovo.
News
of
the
approach
of
the
French
came
from
all
sides,
and
in
one
village,
ten
miles
from
Bogucharovo,
a
homestead
had
been
looted
by
French
marauders.
The
doctor
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
moving
the
prince;
the
provincial
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
sent
an
official
to
Princess
Mary
to
persuade
her
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible,
and
the
head
of
the
rural
police
having
come
to
Bogucharovo
urged
the
same
thing,
saying
that
the
French
were
only
some
twenty-five
miles
away,
that
French
proclamations
were
circulating
in
the
villages,
and
that
if
the
princess
did
not
take
her
father
away
before
the
fifteenth,
he
could
not
answer
for
the
consequences.
The
princess
decided
to
leave
on
the
fifteenth.
The
cares
of
preparation
and
giving
orders,
for
which
everyone
came
to
her,
occupied
her
all
day.
She
spent
the
night
of
the
fourteenth
as
usual,
without
undressing,
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
the
prince
lay.
Several
times,
waking
up,
she
heard
his
groans
and
muttering,
the
creak
of
his
bed,
and
the
steps
of
Tikhon
and
the
doctor
when
they
turned
him
over.
Several
times
she
listened
at
the
door,
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
mutterings
were
louder
than
usual
and
that
they
turned
him
over
oftener.
She
could
not
sleep
and
several
times
went
to
the
door
and
listened,
wishing
to
enter
but
not
deciding
to
do
so.
Though
he
did
not
speak,
Princess
Mary
saw
and
knew
how
unpleasant
every
sign
of
anxiety
on
his
account
was
to
him.
She
had
noticed
with
what
dissatisfaction
he
turned
from
the
look
she
sometimes
involuntarily
fixed
on
him.
She
knew
that
her
going
in
during
the
night
at
an
unusual
hour
would
irritate
him.
But
never
had
she
felt
so
grieved
for
him
or
so
much
afraid
of
losing
him.
She
recalled
all
her
life
with
him
and
in
every
word
and
act
of
his
found
an
expression
of
his
love
of
her.
Occasionally
amid
these
memories
temptations
of
the
devil
would
surge
into
her
imagination:
thoughts
of
how
things
would
be
after
his
death,
and
how
her
new,
liberated
life
would
be
ordered.
But
she
drove
these
thoughts
away
with
disgust.
Toward
morning
he
became
quiet
and
she
fell
asleep.
She
woke
late.
That
sincerity
which
often
comes
with
waking
showed
her
clearly
what
chiefly
concerned
her
about
her
father's
illness.
On
waking
she
listened
to
what
was
going
on
behind
the
door
and,
hearing
him
groan,
said
to
herself
with
a
sigh
that
things
were
still
the
same.
"But
what
could
have
happened?
What
did
I
want?
I
want
his
death!"
she
cried
with
a
feeling
of
loathing
for
herself.
She
washed,
dressed,
said
her
prayers,
and
went
out
to
the
porch.
In
front
of
it
stood
carriages
without
horses
and
things
were
being
packed
into
the
vehicles.
It
was
a
warm,
gray
morning.
Princess
Mary
stopped
at
the
porch,
still
horrified
by
her
spiritual
baseness
and
trying
to
arrange
her
thoughts
before
going
to
her
father.
The
doctor
came
downstairs
and
went
out
to
her.
"He
is
a
little
better
today,"
said
he.
"I
was
looking
for
you.
One
can
make
out
something
of
what
he
is
saying.
His
head
is
clearer.
Come
in,
he
is
asking
for
you..."
Princess
Mary's
heart
beat
so
violently
at
this
news
that
she
grew
pale
and
leaned
against
the
wall
to
keep
from
falling.
To
see
him,
talk
to
him,
feel
his
eyes
on
her
now
that
her
whole
soul
was
overflowing
with
those
dreadful,
wicked
temptations,
was
a
torment
of
joy
and
terror.
"Come,"
said
the
doctor.
Princess
Mary
entered
her
father's
room
and
went
up
to
his
bed.
He
was
lying
on
his
back
propped
up
high,
and
his
small
bony
hands
with
their
knotted
purple
veins
were
lying
on
the
quilt;
his
left
eye
gazed
straight
before
him,
his
right
eye
was
awry,
and
his
brows
and
lips
motionless.
He
seemed
altogether
so
thin,
small,
and
pathetic.
His
face
seemed
to
have
shriveled
or
melted;
his
features
had
grown
smaller.
Princess
Mary
went
up
and
kissed
his
hand.
His
left
hand
pressed
hers
so
that
she
understood
that
he
had
long
been
waiting
for
her
to
come.
He
twitched
her
hand,
and
his
brows
and
lips
quivered
angrily.
She
looked
at
him
in
dismay
trying
to
guess
what
he
wanted
of
her.
When
she
changed
her
position
so
that
his
left
eye
could
see
her
face
he
calmed
down,
not
taking
his
eyes
off
her
for
some
seconds.
Then
his
lips
and
tongue
moved,
sounds
came,
and
he
began
to
speak,
gazing
timidly
and
imploringly
at
her,
evidently
afraid
that
she
might
not
understand.
Straining
all
her
faculties
Princess
Mary
looked
at
him.
The
comic
efforts
with
which
he
moved
his
tongue
made
her
drop
her
eyes
and
with
difficulty
repress
the
sobs
that
rose
to
her
throat.
He
said
something,
repeating
the
same
words
several
times.
She
could
not
understand
them,
but
tried
to
guess
what
he
was
saying
and
inquiringly
repeated
the
words
he
uttered.
"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..."
he
repeated
several
times.
It
was
quite
impossible
to
understand
these
sounds.
The
doctor
thought
he
had
guessed
them,
and
inquiringly
repeated:
"Mary,
are
you
afraid?"
The
prince
shook
his
head,
again
repeated
the
same
sounds.
"My
mind,
my
mind
aches?"
questioned
Princess
Mary.
He
made
a
mumbling
sound
in
confirmation
of
this,
took
her
hand,
and
began
pressing
it
to
different
parts
of
his
breast
as
if
trying
to
find
the
right
place
for
it.
"Always
thoughts...
about
you...
thoughts..."
he
then
uttered
much
more
clearly
than
he
had
done
before,
now
that
he
was
sure
of
being
understood.
Princess
Mary
pressed
her
head
against
his
hand,
trying
to
hide
her
sobs
and
tears.
He
moved
his
hand
over
her
hair.
"I
have
been
calling
you
all
night..."
he
brought
out.
"If
only
I
had
known..."
she
said
through
her
tears.
"I
was
afraid
to
come
in."
He
pressed
her
hand.
"Weren't
you
asleep?"
"No,
I
did
not
sleep,"
said
Princess
Mary,
shaking
her
head.
Unconsciously
imitating
her
father,
she
now
tried
to
express
herself
as
he
did,
as
much
as
possible
by
signs,
and
her
tongue
too
seemed
to
move
with
difficulty.
"Dear
one...
Dearest..."
Princess
Mary
could
not
quite
make
out
what
he
had
said,
but
from
his
look
it
was
clear
that
he
had
uttered
a
tender
caressing
word
such
as
he
had
never
used
to
her
before.
"Why
didn't
you
come
in?"
"And
I
was
wishing
for
his
death!"
thought
Princess
Mary.
He
was
silent
awhile.
"Thank
you...
daughter
dear!...
for
all,
for
all...
forgive!...
thank
you!...
forgive!...
thank
you!..."
and
tears
began
to
flow
from
his
eyes.
"Call
Andrew!"
he
said
suddenly,
and
a
childish,
timid
expression
of
doubt
showed
itself
on
his
face
as
he
spoke.
He
himself
seemed
aware
that
his
demand
was
meaningless.
So
at
least
it
seemed
to
Princess
Mary.
"I
have
a
letter
from
him,"
she
replied.
He
glanced
at
her
with
timid
surprise.
"Where
is
he?"
"He's
with
the
army,
Father,
at
Smolensk."
He
closed
his
eyes
and
remained
silent
a
long
time.
Then
as
if
in
answer
to
his
doubts
and
to
confirm
the
fact
that
now
he
understood
and
remembered
everything,
he
nodded
his
head
and
reopened
his
eyes.
"Yes,"
he
said,
softly
and
distinctly.
"Russia
has
perished.
They've
destroyed
her."
And
he
began
to
sob,
and
again
tears
flowed
from
his
eyes.
Princess
Mary
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
and
wept
while
she
gazed
at
his
face.
Again
he
closed
his
eyes.
His
sobs
ceased,
he
pointed
to
his
eyes,
and
Tikhon,
understanding
him,
wiped
away
the
tears.
Then
he
again
opened
his
eyes
and
said
something
none
of
them
could
understand
for
a
long
time,
till
at
last
Tikhon
understood
and
repeated
it.
Princess
Mary
had
sought
the
meaning
of
his
words
in
the
mood
in
which
he
had
just
been
speaking.
She
thought
he
was
speaking
of
Russia,
or
Prince
Andrew,
of
herself,
of
his
grandson,
or
of
his
own
death,
and
so
she
could
not
guess
his
words.
"Put
on
your
white
dress.
I
like
it,"
was
what
he
said.
Having
understood
this
Princess
Mary
sobbed
still
louder,
and
the
doctor
taking
her
arm
led
her
out
to
the
veranda,
soothing
her
and
trying
to
persuade
her
to
prepare
for
her
journey.
When
she
had
left
the
room
the
prince
again
began
speaking
about
his
son,
about
the
war,
and
about
the
Emperor,
angrily
twitching
his
brows
and
raising
his
hoarse
voice,
and
then
he
had
a
second
and
final
stroke.
Princess
Mary
stayed
on
the
veranda.
The
day
had
cleared,
it
was
hot
and
sunny.
She
could
understand
nothing,
think
of
nothing
and
feel
nothing,
except
passionate
love
for
her
father,
love
such
as
she
thought
she
had
never
felt
till
that
moment.
She
ran
out
sobbing
into
the
garden
and
as
far
as
the
pond,
along
the
avenues
of
young
lime
trees
Prince
Andrew
had
planted.
"Yes...
I...
I...
I
wished
for
his
death!
Yes,
I
wanted
it
to
end
quicker....
I
wished
to
be
at
peace....
And
what
will
become
of
me?
What
use
will
peace
be
when
he
is
no
longer
here?"
Princess
Mary
murmured,
pacing
the
garden
with
hurried
steps
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
bosom
which
heaved
with
convulsive
sobs.
When
she
had
completed
the
tour
of
the
garden,
which
brought
her
again
to
the
house,
she
saw
Mademoiselle
Bourienne--who
had
remained
at
Bogucharovo
and
did
not
wish
to
leave
it--coming
toward
her
with
a
stranger.
This
was
the
Marshal
of
the
Nobility
of
the
district,
who
had
come
personally
to
point
out
to
the
princess
the
necessity
for
her
prompt
departure.
Princess
Mary
listened
without
understanding
him;
she
led
him
to
the
house,
offered
him
lunch,
and
sat
down
with
him.
Then,
excusing
herself,
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
old
prince's
room.
The
doctor
came
out
with
an
agitated
face
and
said
she
could
not
enter.
"Go
away,
Princess!
Go
away...
go
away!"
She
returned
to
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
by
the
pond,
where
no
one
could
see
her.
She
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
there
when
she
was
aroused
by
the
sound
of
a
woman's
footsteps
running
along
the
path.
She
rose
and
saw
Dunyasha
her
maid,
who
was
evidently
looking
for
her,
and
who
stopped
suddenly
as
if
in
alarm
on
seeing
her
mistress.
"Please
come,
Princess...
The
Prince,"
said
Dunyasha
in
a
breaking
voice.
"Immediately,
I'm
coming,
I'm
coming!"
replied
the
princess
hurriedly,
not
giving
Dunyasha
time
to
finish
what
she
was
saying,
and
trying
to
avoid
seeing
the
girl
she
ran
toward
the
house.
"Princess,
it's
God's
will!
You
must
be
prepared
for
everything,"
said
the
Marshal,
meeting
her
at
the
house
door.
"Let
me
alone;
it's
not
true!"
she
cried
angrily
to
him.
The
doctor
tried
to
stop
her.
She
pushed
him
aside
and
ran
to
her
father's
door.
"Why
are
these
people
with
frightened
faces
stopping
me?
I
don't
want
any
of
them!
And
what
are
they
doing
here?"
she
thought.
She
opened
the
door
and
the
bright
daylight
in
that
previously
darkened
room
startled
her.
In
the
room
were
her
nurse
and
other
women.
They
all
drew
back
from
the
bed,
making
way
for
her.
He
was
still
lying
on
the
bed
as
before,
but
the
stern
expression
of
his
quiet
face
made
Princess
Mary
stop
short
on
the
threshold.
"No,
he's
not
dead--it's
impossible!"
she
told
herself
and
approached
him,
and
repressing
the
terror
that
seized
her,
she
pressed
her
lips
to
his
cheek.
But
she
stepped
back
immediately.
All
the
force
of
the
tenderness
she
had
been
feeling
for
him
vanished
instantly
and
was
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
horror
at
what
lay
there
before
her.
"No,
he
is
no
more!
He
is
not,
but
here
where
he
was
is
something
unfamiliar
and
hostile,
some
dreadful,
terrifying,
and
repellent
mystery!"
And
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands,
Princess
Mary
sank
into
the
arms
of
the
doctor,
who
held
her
up.
In
the
presence
of
Tikhon
and
the
doctor
the
women
washed
what
had
been
the
prince,
tied
his
head
up
with
a
handkerchief
that
the
mouth
should
not
stiffen
while
open,
and
with
another
handkerchief
tied
together
the
legs
that
were
already
spreading
apart.
Then
they
dressed
him
in
uniform
with
his
decorations
and
placed
his
shriveled
little
body
on
a
table.
Heaven
only
knows
who
arranged
all
this
and
when,
but
it
all
got
done
as
if
of
its
own
accord.
Toward
night
candles
were
burning
round
his
coffin,
a
pall
was
spread
over
it,
the
floor
was
strewn
with
sprays
of
juniper,
a
printed
band
was
tucked
in
under
his
shriveled
head,
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
sat
a
chanter
reading
the
psalms.
Just
as
horses
shy
and
snort
and
gather
about
a
dead
horse,
so
the
inmates
of
the
house
and
strangers
crowded
into
the
drawing
room
round
the
coffin--the
Marshal,
the
village
Elder,
peasant
women--and
all
with
fixed
and
frightened
eyes,
crossing
themselves,
bowed
and
kissed
the
old
prince's
cold
and
stiffened
hand.
CHAPTER
IX
Until
Prince
Andrew
settled
in
Bogucharovo
its
owners
had
always
been
absentees,
and
its
peasants
were
of
quite
a
different
character
from
those
of
Bald
Hills.
They
differed
from
them
in
speech,
dress,
and
disposition.
They
were
called
steppe
peasants.
The
old
prince
used
to
approve
of
them
for
their
endurance
at
work
when
they
came
to
Bald
Hills
to
help
with
the
harvest
or
to
dig
ponds,
and
ditches,
but
he
disliked
them
for
their
boorishness.
Prince
Andrew's
last
stay
at
Bogucharovo,
when
he
introduced
hospitals
and
schools
and
reduced
the
quitrent
the
peasants
had
to
pay,
had
not
softened
their
disposition
but
had
on
the
contrary
strengthened
in
them
the
traits
of
character
the
old
prince
called
boorishness.
Various
obscure
rumors
were
always
current
among
them:
at
one
time
a
rumor
that
they
would
all
be
enrolled
as
Cossacks;
at
another
of
a
new
religion
to
which
they
were
all
to
be
converted;
then
of
some
proclamation
of
the
Tsar's
and
of
an
oath
to
the
Tsar
Paul
in
1797
(in
connection
with
which
it
was
rumored
that
freedom
had
been
granted
them
but
the
landowners
had
stopped
it),
then
of
Peter
Fedorovich's
return
to
the
throne
in
seven
years'
time,
when
everything
would
be
made
free
and
so
"simple"
that
there
would
be
no
restrictions.
Rumors
of
the
war
with
Bonaparte
and
his
invasion
were
connected
in
their
minds
with
the
same
sort
of
vague
notions
of
Antichrist,
the
end
of
the
world,
and
"pure
freedom."
In
the
vicinity
of
Bogucharovo
were
large
villages
belonging
to
the
crown
or
to
owners
whose
serfs
paid
quitrent
and
could
work
where
they
pleased.
There
were
very
few
resident
landlords
in
the
neighborhood
and
also
very
few
domestic
or
literate
serfs,
and
in
the
lives
of
the
peasantry
of
those
parts
the
mysterious
undercurrents
in
the
life
of
the
Russian
people,
the
causes
and
meaning
of
which
are
so
baffling
to
contemporaries,
were
more
clearly
and
strongly
noticeable
than
among
others.
One
instance,
which
had
occurred
some
twenty
years
before,
was
a
movement
among
the
peasants
to
emigrate
to
some
unknown
"warm
rivers."
Hundreds
of
peasants,
among
them
the
Bogucharovo
folk,
suddenly
began
selling
their
cattle
and
moving
in
whole
families
toward
the
southeast.
As
birds
migrate
to
somewhere
beyond
the
sea,
so
these
men
with
their
wives
and
children
streamed
to
the
southeast,
to
parts
where
none
of
them
had
ever
been.
They
set
off
in
caravans,
bought
their
freedom
one
by
one
or
ran
away,
and
drove
or
walked
toward
the
"warm
rivers."
Many
of
them
were
punished,
some
sent
to
Siberia,
many
died
of
cold
and
hunger
on
the
road,
many
returned
of
their
own
accord,
and
the
movement
died
down
of
itself
just
as
it
had
sprung
up,
without
apparent
reason.
But
such
undercurrents
still
existed
among
the
people
and
gathered
new
forces
ready
to
manifest
themselves
just
as
strangely,
unexpectedly,
and
at
the
same
time
simply,
naturally,
and
forcibly.
Now
in
1812,
to
anyone
living
in
close
touch
with
these
people
it
was
apparent
that
these
undercurrents
were
acting
strongly
and
nearing
an
eruption.
Alpatych,
who
had
reached
Bogucharovo
shortly
before
the
old
prince's
death,
noticed
an
agitation
among
the
peasants,
and
that
contrary
to
what
was
happening
in
the
Bald
Hills
district,
where
over
a
radius
of
forty
miles
all
the
peasants
were
moving
away
and
leaving
their
villages
to
be
devastated
by
the
Cossacks,
the
peasants
in
the
steppe
region
round
Bogucharovo
were,
it
was
rumored,
in
touch
with
the
French,
received
leaflets
from
them
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand,
and
did
not
migrate.
He
learned
from
domestic
serfs
loyal
to
him
that
the
peasant
Karp,
who
possessed
great
influence
in
the
village
commune
and
had
recently
been
away
driving
a
government
transport,
had
returned
with
news
that
the
Cossacks
were
destroying
deserted
villages,
but
that
the
French
did
not
harm
them.
Alpatych
also
knew
that
on
the
previous
day
another
peasant
had
even
brought
from
the
village
of
Visloukhovo,
which
was
occupied
by
the
French,
a
proclamation
by
a
French
general
that
no
harm
would
be
done
to
the
inhabitants,
and
if
they
remained
they
would
be
paid
for
anything
taken
from
them.
As
proof
of
this
the
peasant
had
brought
from
Visloukhovo
a
hundred
rubles
in
notes
(he
did
not
know
that
they
were
false)
paid
to
him
in
advance
for
hay.
More
important
still,
Alpatych
learned
that
on
the
morning
of
the
very
day
he
gave
the
village
Elder
orders
to
collect
carts
to
move
the
princess'
luggage
from
Bogucharovo,
there
had
been
a
village
meeting
at
which
it
had
been
decided
not
to
move
but
to
wait.
Yet
there
was
no
time
to
waste.
On
the
fifteenth,
the
day
of
the
old
prince's
death,
the
Marshal
had
insisted
on
Princess
Mary's
leaving
at
once,
as
it
was
becoming
dangerous.
He
had
told
her
that
after
the
sixteenth
he
could
not
be
responsible
for
what
might
happen.
On
the
evening
of
the
day
the
old
prince
died
the
Marshal
went
away,
promising
to
return
next
day
for
the
funeral.
But
this
he
was
unable
to
do,
for
he
received
tidings
that
the
French
had
unexpectedly
advanced,
and
had
barely
time
to
remove
his
own
family
and
valuables
from
his
estate.
For
some
thirty
years
Bogucharovo
had
been
managed
by
the
village
Elder,
Dron,
whom
the
old
prince
called
by
the
diminutive
"Dronushka."
Dron
was
one
of
those
physically
and
mentally
vigorous
peasants
who
grow
big
beards
as
soon
as
they
are
of
age
and
go
on
unchanged
till
they
are
sixty
or
seventy,
without
a
gray
hair
or
the
loss
of
a
tooth,
as
straight
and
strong
at
sixty
as
at
thirty.
Soon
after
the
migration
to
the
"warm
rivers,"
in
which
he
had
taken
part
like
the
rest,
Dron
was
made
village
Elder
and
overseer
of
Bogucharovo,
and
had
since
filled
that
post
irreproachably
for
twenty-
three
years.
The
peasants
feared
him
more
than
they
did
their
master.
The
masters,
both
the
old
prince
and
the
young,
and
the
steward
respected
him
and
jestingly
called
him
"the
Minister."
During
the
whole
time
of
his
service
Dron
had
never
been
drunk
or
ill,
never
after
sleepless
nights
or
the
hardest
tasks
had
he
shown
the
least
fatigue,
and
though
he
could
not
read
he
had
never
forgotten
a
single
money
account
or
the
number
of
quarters
of
flour
in
any
of
the
endless
cartloads
he
sold
for
the
prince,
nor
a
single
shock
of
the
whole
corn
crop
on
any
single
acre
of
the
Bogucharovo
fields.
Alpatych,
arriving
from
the
devastated
Bald
Hills
estate,
sent
for
his
Dron
on
the
day
of
the
prince's
funeral
and
told
him
to
have
twelve
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess'
carriages
and
eighteen
carts
for
the
things
to
be
removed
from
Bogucharovo.
Though
the
peasants
paid
quitrent,
Alpatych
thought
no
difficulty
would
be
made
about
complying
with
this
order,
for
there
were
two
hundred
and
thirty
households
at
work
in
Bogucharovo
and
the
peasants
were
well
to
do.
But
on
hearing
the
order
Dron
lowered
his
eyes
and
remained
silent.
Alpatych
named
certain
peasants
he
knew,
from
whom
he
told
him
to
take
the
carts.
Dron
replied
that
the
horses
of
these
peasants
were
away
carting.
Alpatych
named
others,
but
they
too,
according
to
Dron,
had
no
horses
available:
some
horses
were
carting
for
the
government,
others
were
too
weak,
and
others
had
died
for
want
of
fodder.
It
seemed
that
no
horses
could
be
had
even
for
the
carriages,
much
less
for
the
carting.
Alpatych
looked
intently
at
Dron
and
frowned.
Just
as
Dron
was
a
model
village
Elder,
so
Alpatych
had
not
managed
the
prince's
estates
for
twenty
years
in
vain.
He
was
a
model
steward,
possessing
in
the
highest
degree
the
faculty
of
divining
the
needs
and
instincts
of
those
he
dealt
with.
Having
glanced
at
Dron
he
at
once
understood
that
his
answers
did
not
express
his
personal
views
but
the
general
mood
of
the
Bogucharovo
commune,
by
which
the
Elder
had
already
been
carried
away.
But
he
also
knew
that
Dron,
who
had
acquired
property
and
was
hated
by
the
commune,
must
be
hesitating
between
the
two
camps:
the
masters'
and
the
serfs'.
He
noticed
this
hesitation
in
Dron's
look
and
therefore
frowned
and
moved
closer
up
to
him.
"Now
just
listen,
Dronushka,"
said
he.
"Don't
talk
nonsense
to
me.
His
excellency
Prince
Andrew
himself
gave
me
orders
to
move
all
the
people
away
and
not
leave
them
with
the
enemy,
and
there
is
an
order
from
the
Tsar
about
it
too.
Anyone
who
stays
is
a
traitor
to
the
Tsar.
Do
you
hear?"
"I
hear,"
Dron
answered
without
lifting
his
eyes.
Alpatych
was
not
satisfied
with
this
reply.
"Eh,
Dron,
it
will
turn
out
badly!"
he
said,
shaking
his
head.
"The
power
is
in
your
hands,"
Dron
rejoined
sadly.
"Eh,
Dron,
drop
it!"
Alpatych
repeated,
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
bosom
and
solemnly
pointing
to
the
floor
at
Dron's
feet.
"I
can
see
through
you
and
three
yards
into
the
ground
under
you,"
he
continued,
gazing
at
the
floor
in
front
of
Dron.
Dron
was
disconcerted,
glanced
furtively
at
Alpatych
and
again
lowered
his
eyes.
"You
drop
this
nonsense
and
tell
the
people
to
get
ready
to
leave
their
homes
and
go
to
Moscow
and
to
get
carts
ready
for
tomorrow
morning
for
the
princess'
things.
And
don't
go
to
any
meeting
yourself,
do
you
hear?"
Dron
suddenly
fell
on
his
knees.
"Yakov
Alpatych,
discharge
me!
Take
the
keys
from
me
and
discharge
me,
for
Christ's
sake!"
"Stop
that!"
cried
Alpatych
sternly.
"I
see
through
you
and
three
yards
under
you,"
he
repeated,
knowing
that
his
skill
in
beekeeping,
his
knowledge
of
the
right
time
to
sow
the
oats,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
been
able
to
retain
the
old
prince's
favor
for
twenty
years
had
long
since
gained
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
wizard,
and
that
the
power
of
seeing
three
yards
under
a
man
is
considered
an
attribute
of
wizards.
Dron
got
up
and
was
about
to
say
something,
but
Alpatych
interrupted
him.
"What
is
it
you
have
got
into
your
heads,
eh?...
What
are
you
thinking
of,
eh?"
"What
am
I
to
do
with
the
people?"
said
Dron.
"They're
quite
beside
themselves;
I
have
already
told
them..."
"'Told
them,'
I
dare
say!"
said
Alpatych.
"Are
they
drinking?"
he
asked
abruptly.
"Quite
beside
themselves,
Yakov
Alpatych;
they've
fetched
another
barrel."
"Well,
then,
listen!
I'll
go
to
the
police
officer,
and
you
tell
them
so,
and
that
they
must
stop
this
and
the
carts
must
be
got
ready."
"I
understand."
Alpatych
did
not
insist
further.
He
had
managed
people
for
a
long
time
and
knew
that
the
chief
way
to
make
them
obey
is
to
show
no
suspicion
that
they
can
possibly
disobey.
Having
wrung
a
submissive
"I
understand"
from
Dron,
Alpatych
contented
himself
with
that,
though
he
not
only
doubted
but
felt
almost
certain
that
without
the
help
of
troops
the
carts
would
not
be
forthcoming.
And
so
it
was,
for
when
evening
came
no
carts
had
been
provided.
In
the
village,
outside
the
drink
shop,
another
meeting
was
being
held,
which
decided
that
the
horses
should
be
driven
out
into
the
woods
and
the
carts
should
not
be
provided.
Without
saying
anything
of
this
to
the
princess,
Alpatych
had
his
own
belongings
taken
out
of
the
carts
which
had
arrived
from
Bald
Hills
and
had
those
horses
got
ready
for
the
princess'
carriages.
Meanwhile
he
went
himself
to
the
police
authorities.
CHAPTER
X
After
her
father's
funeral
Princess
Mary
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
and
did
not
admit
anyone.
A
maid
came
to
the
door
to
say
that
Alpatych
was
asking
for
orders
about
their
departure.
(This
was
before
his
talk
with
Dron.)
Princess
Mary
raised
herself
on
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
lying
and
replied
through
the
closed
door
that
she
did
not
mean
to
go
away
and
begged
to
be
left
in
peace.
The
windows
of
the
room
in
which
she
was
lying
looked
westward.
She
lay
on
the
sofa
with
her
face
to
the
wall,
fingering
the
buttons
of
the
leather
cushion
and
seeing
nothing
but
that
cushion,
and
her
confused
thoughts
were
centered
on
one
subject--the
irrevocability
of
death
and
her
own
spiritual
baseness,
which
she
had
not
suspected,
but
which
had
shown
itself
during
her
father's
illness.
She
wished
to
pray
but
did
not
dare
to,
dared
not
in
her
present
state
of
mind
address
herself
to
God.
She
lay
for
a
long
time
in
that
position.
The
sun
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
house,
and
its
slanting
rays
shone
into
the
open
window,
lighting
up
the
room
and
part
of
the
morocco
cushion
at
which
Princess
Mary
was
looking.
The
flow
of
her
thoughts
suddenly
stopped.
Unconsciously
she
sat
up,
smoothed
her
hair,
got
up,
and
went
to
the
window,
involuntarily
inhaling
the
freshness
of
the
clear
but
windy
evening.
"Yes,
you
can
well
enjoy
the
evening
now!
He
is
gone
and
no
one
will
hinder
you,"
she
said
to
herself,
and
sinking
into
a
chair
she
let
her
head
fall
on
the
window
sill.
Someone
spoke
her
name
in
a
soft
and
tender
voice
from
the
garden
and
kissed
her
head.
She
looked
up.
It
was
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
in
a
black
dress
and
weepers.
She
softly
approached
Princess
Mary,
sighed,
kissed
her,
and
immediately
began
to
cry.
The
princess
looked
up
at
her.
All
their
former
disharmony
and
her
own
jealousy
recurred
to
her
mind.
But
she
remembered
too
how
he
had
changed
of
late
toward
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
and
could
not
bear
to
see
her,
thereby
showing
how
unjust
were
the
reproaches
Princess
Mary
had
mentally
addressed
to
her.
"Besides,
is
it
for
me,
for
me
who
desired
his
death,
to
condemn
anyone?"
she
thought.
Princess
Mary
vividly
pictured
to
herself
the
position
of
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
whom
she
had
of
late
kept
at
a
distance,
but
who
yet
was
dependent
on
her
and
living
in
her
house.
She
felt
sorry
for
her
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
glance
of
gentle
inquiry.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
at
once
began
crying
again
and
kissed
that
hand,
speaking
of
the
princess'
sorrow
and
making
herself
a
partner
in
it.
She
said
her
only
consolation
was
the
fact
that
the
princess
allowed
her
to
share
her
sorrow,
that
all
the
old
misunderstandings
should
sink
into
nothing
but
this
great
grief;
that
she
felt
herself
blameless
in
regard
to
everyone,
and
that
he,
from
above,
saw
her
affection
and
gratitude.
The
princess
heard
her,
not
heeding
her
words
but
occasionally
looking
up
at
her
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
her
voice.
"Your
position
is
doubly
terrible,
dear
princess,"
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
after
a
pause.
"I
understand
that
you
could
not,
and
cannot,
think
of
yourself,
but
with
my
love
for
you
I
must
do
so....
Has
Alpatych
been
to
you?
Has
he
spoken
to
you
of
going
away?"
she
asked.
Princess
Mary
did
not
answer.
She
did
not
understand
who
was
to
go
or
where
to.
"Is
it
possible
to
plan
or
think
of
anything
now?
Is
it
not
all
the
same?"
she
thought,
and
did
not
reply.
"You
know,
chere
Marie,"
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne,
"that
we
are
in
danger--are
surrounded
by
the
French.
It
would
be
dangerous
to
move
now.
If
we
go
we
are
almost
sure
to
be
taken
prisoners,
and
God
knows..."
Princess
Mary
looked
at
her
companion
without
understanding
what
she
was
talking
about.
"Oh,
if
anyone
knew
how
little
anything
matters
to
me
now,"
she
said.
"Of
course
I
would
on
no
account
wish
to
go
away
from
him....
Alpatych
did
say
something
about
going....
Speak
to
him;
I
can
do
nothing,
nothing,
and
don't
want
to...."
"I've
spoken
to
him.
He
hopes
we
should
be
in
time
to
get
away
tomorrow,
but
I
think
it
would
now
be
better
to
stay
here,"
said
Mademoiselle
Bourienne.
"Because,
you
will
agree,
chere
Marie,
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
soldiers
or
of
riotous
peasants
would
be
terrible."
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
took
from
her
reticule
a
proclamation
(not
printed
on
ordinary
Russian
paper)
of
General
Rameau's,
telling
people
not
to
leave
their
homes
and
that
the
French
authorities
would
afford
them
proper
protection.
She
handed
this
to
the
princess.
"I
think
it
would
be
best
to
appeal
to
that
general,"
she
continued,
"and
I
am
sure
that
all
due
respect
would
be
shown
you."
Princess
Mary
read
the
paper,
and
her
face
began
to
quiver
with
stifled
sobs.
"From
whom
did
you
get
this?"
she
asked.
"They
probably
recognized
that
I
am
French,
by
my
name,"
replied
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
blushing.
Princess
Mary,
with
the
paper
in
her
hand,
rose
from
the
window
and
with
a
pale
face
went
out
of
the
room
and
into
what
had
been
Prince
Andrew's
study.
"Dunyasha,
send
Alpatych,
or
Dronushka,
or
somebody
to
me!"
she
said,
"and
tell
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
not
to
come
to
me,"
she
added,
hearing
Mademoiselle
Bourienne's
voice.
"We
must
go
at
once,
at
once!"
she
said,
appalled
at
the
thought
of
being
left
in
the
hands
of
the
French.
"If
Prince
Andrew
heard
that
I
was
in
the
power
of
the
French!
That
I,
the
daughter
of
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski,
asked
General
Rameau
for
protection
and
accepted
his
favor!"
This
idea
horrified
her,
made
her
shudder,
blush,
and
feel
such
a
rush
of
anger
and
pride
as
she
had
never
experienced
before.
All
that
was
distressing,
and
especially
all
that
was
humiliating,
in
her
position
rose
vividly
to
her
mind.
"They,
the
French,
would
settle
in
this
house:
M.
le
General
Rameau
would
occupy
Prince
Andrew's
study
and
amuse
himself
by
looking
through
and
reading
his
letters
and
papers.
Mademoiselle
Bourienne
would
do
the
honors
of
Bogucharovo
for
him.
I
should
be
given
a
small
room
as
a
favor,
the
soldiers
would
violate
my
father's
newly
dug
grave
to
steal
his
crosses
and
stars,
they
would
tell
me
of
their
victories
over
the
Russians,
and
would
pretend
to
sympathize
with
my
sorrow..."
thought
Princess
Mary,
not
thinking
her
own
thoughts
but
feeling
bound
to
think
like
her
father
and
her
brother.
For
herself
she
did
not
care
where
she
remained
or
what
happened
to
her,
but
she
felt
herself
the
representative
of
her
dead
father
and
of
Prince
Andrew.
Involuntarily
she
thought
their
thoughts
and
felt
their
feelings.
What
they
would
have
said
and
what
they
would
have
done
she
felt
bound
to
say
and
do.
She
went
into
Prince
Andrew's
study,
trying
to
enter
completely
into
his
ideas,
and
considered
her
position.
The
demands
of
life,
which
had
seemed
to
her
annihilated
by
her
father's
death,
all
at
once
rose
before
her
with
a
new,
previously
unknown
force
and
took
possession
of
her.
Agitated
and
flushed
she
paced
the
room,
sending
now
for
Michael
Ivanovich
and
now
for
Tikhon
or
Dron.
Dunyasha,
the
nurse,
and
the
other
maids
could
not
say
in
how
far
Mademoiselle
Bourienne's
statement
was
correct.
Alpatych
was
not
at
home,
he
had
gone
to
the
police.
Neither
could
the
architect
Michael
Ivanovich,
who
on
being
sent
for
came
in
with
sleepy
eyes,
tell
Princess
Mary
anything.
With
just
the
same
smile
of
agreement
with
which
for
fifteen
years
he
had
been
accustomed
to
answer
the
old
prince
without
expressing
views
of
his
own,
he
now
replied
to
Princess
Mary,
so
that
nothing
definite
could
be
got
from
his
answers.
The
old
valet
Tikhon,
with
sunken,
emaciated
face
that
bore
the
stamp
of
inconsolable
grief,
replied:
"Yes,
Princess"
to
all
Princess
Mary's
questions
and
hardly
refrained
from
sobbing
as
he
looked
at
her.
At
length
Dron,
the
village
Elder,
entered
the
room
and
with
a
deep
bow
to
Princess
Mary
came
to
a
halt
by
the
doorpost.
Princess
Mary
walked
up
and
down
the
room
and
stopped
in
front
of
him.
"Dronushka,"
she
said,
regarding
as
a
sure
friend
this
Dronushka
who
always
used
to
bring
a
special
kind
of
gingerbread
from
his
visit
to
the
fair
at
Vyazma
every
year
and
smilingly
offer
it
to
her,
"Dronushka,
now
since
our
misfortune..."
she
began,
but
could
not
go
on.
"We
are
all
in
God's
hands,"
said
he,
with
a
sigh.
They
were
silent
for
a
while.
"Dronushka,
Alpatych
has
gone
off
somewhere
and
I
have
no
one
to
turn
to.
Is
it
true,
as
they
tell
me,
that
I
can't
even
go
away?"
"Why
shouldn't
you
go
away,
your
excellency?
You
can
go,"
said
Dron.
"I
was
told
it
would
be
dangerous
because
of
the
enemy.
Dear
friend,
I
can
do
nothing.
I
understand
nothing.
I
have
nobody!
I
want
to
go
away
tonight
or
early
tomorrow
morning."
Dron
paused.
He
looked
askance
at
Princess
Mary
and
said:
"There
are
no
horses;
I
told
Yakov
Alpatych
so."
"Why
are
there
none?"
asked
the
princess.
"It's
all
God's
scourge,"
said
Dron.
"What
horses
we
had
have
been
taken
for
the
army
or
have
died--this
is
such
a
year!
It's
not
a
case
of
feeding
horses--we
may
die
of
hunger
ourselves!
As
it
is,
some
go
three
days
without
eating.
We've
nothing,
we've
been
ruined."
Princess
Mary
listened
attentively
to
what
he
told
her.
"The
peasants
are
ruined?
They
have
no
bread?"
she
asked.
"They're
dying
of
hunger,"
said
Dron.
"It's
not
a
case
of
carting."
"But
why
didn't
you
tell
me,
Dronushka?
Isn't
it
possible
to
help
them?
I'll
do
all
I
can...."
To
Princess
Mary
it
was
strange
that
now,
at
a
moment
when
such
sorrow
was
filling
her
soul,
there
could
be
rich
people
and
poor,
and
the
rich
could
refrain
from
helping
the
poor.
She
had
heard
vaguely
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
"landlord's
corn"
which
was
sometimes
given
to
the
peasants.
She
also
knew
that
neither
her
father
nor
her
brother
would
refuse
to
help
the
peasants
in
need,
she
only
feared
to
make
some
mistake
in
speaking
about
the
distribution
of
the
grain
she
wished
to
give.
She
was
glad
such
cares
presented
themselves,
enabling
her
without
scruple
to
forget
her
own
grief.
She
began
asking
Dron
about
the
peasants'
needs
and
what
there
was
in
Bogucharovo
that
belonged
to
the
landlord.
"But
we
have
grain
belonging
to
my
brother?"
she
said.
"The
landlord's
grain
is
all
safe,"
replied
Dron
proudly.
"Our
prince
did
not
order
it
to
be
sold."
"Give
it
to
the
peasants,
let
them
have
all
they
need;
I
give
you
leave
in
my
brother's
name,"
said
she.
Dron
made
no
answer
but
sighed
deeply.
"Give
them
that
corn
if
there
is
enough
of
it.
Distribute
it
all.
I
give
this
order
in
my
brother's
name;
and
tell
them
that
what
is
ours
is
theirs.
We
do
not
grudge
them
anything.
Tell
them
so."
Dron
looked
intently
at
the
princess
while
she
was
speaking.
"Discharge
me,
little
mother,
for
God's
sake!
Order
the
keys
to
be
taken
from
me,"
said
he.
"I
have
served
twenty-three
years
and
have
done
no
wrong.
Discharge
me,
for
God's
sake!"
Princess
Mary
did
not
understand
what
he
wanted
of
her
or
why
he
was
asking
to
be
discharged.
She
replied
that
she
had
never
doubted
his
devotion
and
that
she
was
ready
to
do
anything
for
him
and
for
the
peasants.
CHAPTER
XI
An
hour
later
Dunyasha
came
to
tell
the
princess
that
Dron
had
come,
and
all
the
peasants
had
assembled
at
the
barn
by
the
princess'
order
and
wished
to
have
word
with
their
mistress.
"But
I
never
told
them
to
come,"
said
Princess
Mary.
"I
only
told
Dron
to
let
them
have
the
grain."
"Only,
for
God's
sake,
Princess
dear,
have
them
sent
away
and
don't
go
out
to
them.
It's
all
a
trick,"
said
Dunyasha,
"and
when
Yakov
Alpatych
returns
let
us
get
away...
and
please
don't..."
"What
is
a
trick?"
asked
Princess
Mary
in
surprise.
"I
know
it
is,
only
listen
to
me
for
God's
sake!
Ask
nurse
too.
They
say
they
don't
agree
to
leave
Bogucharovo
as
you
ordered."
"You're
making
some
mistake.
I
never
ordered
them
to
go
away,"
said
Princess
Mary.
"Call
Dronushka."
Dron
came
and
confirmed
Dunyasha's
words;
the
peasants
had
come
by
the
princess'
order.
"But
I
never
sent
for
them,"
declared
the
princess.
"You
must
have
given
my
message
wrong.
I
only
said
that
you
were
to
give
them
the
grain."
Dron
only
sighed
in
reply.
"If
you
order
it
they
will
go
away,"
said
he.
"No,
no.
I'll
go
out
to
them,"
said
Princess
Mary,
and
in
spite
of
the
nurse's
and
Dunyasha's
protests
she
went
out
into
the
porch;
Dron,
Dunyasha,
the
nurse,
and
Michael
Ivanovich
following
her.
"They
probably
think
I
am
offering
them
the
grain
to
bribe
them
to
remain
here,
while
I
myself
go
away
leaving
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
French,"
thought
Princess
Mary.
"I
will
offer
them
monthly
rations
and
housing
at
our
Moscow
estate.
I
am
sure
Andrew
would
do
even
more
in
my
place,"
she
thought
as
she
went
out
in
the
twilight
toward
the
crowd
standing
on
the
pasture
by
the
barn.
The
men
crowded
closer
together,
stirred,
and
rapidly
took
off
their
hats.
Princess
Mary
lowered
her
eyes
and,
tripping
over
her
skirt,
came
close
up
to
them.
So
many
different
eyes,
old
and
young,
were
fixed
on
her,
and
there
were
so
many
different
faces,
that
she
could
not
distinguish
any
of
them
and,
feeling
that
she
must
speak
to
them
all
at
once,
did
not
know
how
to
do
it.
But
again
the
sense
that
she
represented
her
father
and
her
brother
gave
her
courage,
and
she
boldly
began
her
speech.
"I
am
very
glad
you
have
come,"
she
said
without
raising
her
eyes,
and
feeling
her
heart
beating
quickly
and
violently.
"Dronushka
tells
me
that
the
war
has
ruined
you.
That
is
our
common
misfortune,
and
I
shall
grudge
nothing
to
help
you.
I
am
myself
going
away
because
it
is
dangerous
here...
the
enemy
is
near...
because...
I
am
giving
you
everything,
my
friends,
and
I
beg
you
to
take
everything,
all
our
grain,
so
that
you
may
not
suffer
want!
And
if
you
have
been
told
that
I
am
giving
you
the
grain
to
keep
you
here--that
is
not
true.
On
the
contrary,
I
ask
you
to
go
with
all
your
belongings
to
our
estate
near
Moscow,
and
I
promise
you
I
will
see
to
it
that
there
you
shall
want
for
nothing.
You
shall
be
given
food
and
lodging."
The
princess
stopped.
Sighs
were
the
only
sound
heard
in
the
crowd.
"I
am
not
doing
this
on
my
own
account,"
she
continued,
"I
do
it
in
the
name
of
my
dead
father,
who
was
a
good
master
to
you,
and
of
my
brother
and
his
son."
Again
she
paused.
No
one
broke
the
silence.
"Ours
is
a
common
misfortune
and
we
will
share
it
together.
All
that
is
mine
is
yours,"
she
concluded,
scanning
the
faces
before
her.
All
eyes
were
gazing
at
her
with
one
and
the
same
expression.
She
could
not
fathom
whether
it
was
curiosity,
devotion,
gratitude,
or
apprehension
and
distrust--but
the
expression
on
all
the
faces
was
identical.
"We
are
all
very
thankful
for
your
bounty,
but
it
won't
do
for
us
to
take
the
landlord's
grain,"
said
a
voice
at
the
back
of
the
crowd.
"But
why
not?"
asked
the
princess.
No
one
replied
and
Princess
Mary,
looking
round
at
the
crowd,
found
that
every
eye
she
met
now
was
immediately
dropped.
"But
why
don't
you
want
to
take
it?"
she
asked
again.
No
one
answered.
The
silence
began
to
oppress
the
princess
and
she
tried
to
catch
someone's
eye.
"Why
don't
you
speak?"
she
inquired
of
a
very
old
man
who
stood
just
in
front
of
her
leaning
on
his
stick.
"If
you
think
something
more
is
wanted,
tell
me!
I
will
do
anything,"
said
she,
catching
his
eye.
But
as
if
this
angered
him,
he
bent
his
head
quite
low
and
muttered:
"Why
should
we
agree?
We
don't
want
the
grain."
"Why
should
we
give
up
everything?
We
don't
agree.
Don't
agree....
We
are
sorry
for
you,
but
we're
not
willing.
Go
away
yourself,
alone..."
came
from
various
sides
of
the
crowd.
And
again
all
the
faces
in
that
crowd
bore
an
identical
expression,
though
now
it
was
certainly
not
an
expression
of
curiosity
or
gratitude,
but
of
angry
resolve.
"But
you
can't
have
understood
me,"
said
Princess
Mary
with
a
sad
smile.
"Why
don't
you
want
to
go?
I
promise
to
house
and
feed
you,
while
here
the
enemy
would
ruin
you..."
But
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
voices
of
the
crowd.
"We're
not
willing.
Let
them
ruin
us!
We
won't
take
your
grain.
We
don't
agree."
Again
Princess
Mary
tried
to
catch
someone's
eye,
but
not
a
single
eye
in
the
crowd
was
turned
to
her;
evidently
they
were
all
trying
to
avoid
her
look.
She
felt
strange
and
awkward.
"Oh
yes,
an
artful
tale!
Follow
her
into
slavery!
Pull
down
your
houses
and
go
into
bondage!
I
dare
say!
'I'll
give
you
grain,
indeed!'
she
says,"
voices
in
the
crowd
were
heard
saying.
With
drooping
head
Princess
Mary
left
the
crowd
and
went
back
to
the
house.
Having
repeated
her
order
to
Dron
to
have
horses
ready
for
her
departure
next
morning,
she
went
to
her
room
and
remained
alone
with
her
own
thoughts.
CHAPTER
XII
For
a
long
time
that
night
Princess
Mary
sat
by
the
open
window
of
her
room
hearing
the
sound
of
the
peasants'
voices
that
reached
her
from
the
village,
but
it
was
not
of
them
she
was
thinking.
She
felt
that
she
could
not
understand
them
however
much
she
might
think
about
them.
She
thought
only
of
one
thing,
her
sorrow,
which,
after
the
break
caused
by
cares
for
the
present,
seemed
already
to
belong
to
the
past.
Now
she
could
remember
it
and
weep
or
pray.
After
sunset
the
wind
had
dropped.
The
night
was
calm
and
fresh.
Toward
midnight
the
voices
began
to
subside,
a
cock
crowed,
the
full
moon
began
to
show
from
behind
the
lime
trees,
a
fresh
white
dewy
mist
began
to
rise,
and
stillness
reigned
over
the
village
and
the
house.
Pictures
of
the
near
past--her
father's
illness
and
last
moments--rose
one
after
another
to
her
memory.
With
mournful
pleasure
she
now
lingered
over
these
images,
repelling
with
horror
only
the
last
one,
the
picture
of
his
death,
which
she
felt
she
could
not
contemplate
even
in
imagination
at
this
still
and
mystic
hour
of
night.
And
these
pictures
presented
themselves
to
her
so
clearly
and
in
such
detail
that
they
seemed
now
present,
now
past,
and
now
future.
She
vividly
recalled
the
moment
when
he
had
his
first
stroke
and
was
being
dragged
along
by
his
armpits
through
the
garden
at
Bald
Hills,
muttering
something
with
his
helpless
tongue,
twitching
his
gray
eyebrows
and
looking
uneasily
and
timidly
at
her.
"Even
then
he
wanted
to
tell
me
what
he
told
me
the
day
he
died,"
she
thought.
"He
had
always
thought
what
he
said
then."
And
she
recalled
in
all
its
detail
the
night
at
Bald
Hills
before
he
had
the
last
stroke,
when
with
a
foreboding
of
disaster
she
had
remained
at
home
against
his
will.
She
had
not
slept
and
had
stolen
downstairs
on
tiptoe,
and
going
to
the
door
of
the
conservatory
where
he
slept
that
night
had
listened
at
the
door.
In
a
suffering
and
weary
voice
he
was
saying
something
to
Tikhon,
speaking
of
the
Crimea
and
its
warm
nights
and
of
the
Empress.
Evidently
he
had
wanted
to
talk.
"And
why
didn't
he
call
me?
Why
didn't
he
let
me
be
there
instead
of
Tikhon?"
Princess
Mary
had
thought
and
thought
again
now.
"Now
he
will
never
tell
anyone
what
he
had
in
his
soul.
Never
will
that
moment
return
for
him
or
for
me
when
he
might
have
said
all
he
longed
to
say,
and
not
Tikhon
but
I
might
have
heard
and
understood
him.
Why
didn't
I
enter
the
room?"
she
thought.
"Perhaps
he
would
then
have
said
to
me
what
he
said
the
day
he
died.
While
talking
to
Tikhon
he
asked
about
me
twice.
He
wanted
to
see
me,
and
I
was
standing
close
by,
outside
the
door.
It
was
sad
and
painful
for
him
to
talk
to
Tikhon
who
did
not
understand
him.
I
remember
how
he
began
speaking
to
him
about
Lise
as
if
she
were
alive--he
had
forgotten
she
was
dead--and
Tikhon
reminded
him
that
she
was
no
more,
and
he
shouted,
'Fool!'
He
was
greatly
depressed.
From
behind
the
door
I
heard
how
he
lay
down
on
his
bed
groaning
and
loudly
exclaimed,
'My
God!'
Why
didn't
I
go
in
then?
What
could
he
have
done
to
me?
What
could
I
have
lost?
And
perhaps
he
would
then
have
been
comforted
and
would
have
said
that
word
to
me."
And
Princess
Mary
uttered
aloud
the
caressing
word
he
had
said
to
her
on
the
day
of
his
death.
"Dear-est!"
she
repeated,
and
began
sobbing,
with
tears
that
relieved
her
soul.
She
now
saw
his
face
before
her.
And
not
the
face
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
and
had
always
seen
at
a
distance,
but
the
timid,
feeble
face
she
had
seen
for
the
first
time
quite
closely,
with
all
its
wrinkles
and
details,
when
she
stooped
near
to
his
mouth
to
catch
what
he
said.
"Dear-est!"
she
repeated
again.
"What
was
he
thinking
when
he
uttered
that
word?
What
is
he
thinking
now?"
This
question
suddenly
presented
itself
to
her,
and
in
answer
she
saw
him
before
her
with
the
expression
that
was
on
his
face
as
he
lay
in
his
coffin
with
his
chin
bound
up
with
a
white
handkerchief.
And
the
horror
that
had
seized
her
when
she
touched
him
and
convinced
herself
that
that
was
not
he,
but
something
mysterious
and
horrible,
seized
her
again.
She
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
to
pray,
but
could
do
neither.
With
wide-open
eyes
she
gazed
at
the
moonlight
and
the
shadows,
expecting
every
moment
to
see
his
dead
face,
and
she
felt
that
the
silence
brooding
over
the
house
and
within
it
held
her
fast.
"Dunyasha,"
she
whispered.
"Dunyasha!"
she
screamed
wildly,
and
tearing
herself
out
of
this
silence
she
ran
to
the
servants'
quarters
to
meet
her
old
nurse
and
the
maidservants
who
came
running
toward
her.
CHAPTER
XIII
On
the
seventeenth
of
August
Rostov
and
Ilyin,
accompanied
by
Lavrushka
who
had
just
returned
from
captivity
and
by
an
hussar
orderly,
left
their
quarters
at
Yankovo,
ten
miles
from
Bogucharovo,
and
went
for
a
ride--to
try
a
new
horse
Ilyin
had
bought
and
to
find
out
whether
there
was
any
hay
to
be
had
in
the
villages.
For
the
last
three
days
Bogucharovo
had
lain
between
the
two
hostile
armies,
so
that
it
was
as
easy
for
the
Russian
rearguard
to
get
to
it
as
for
the
French
vanguard;
Rostov,
as
a
careful
squadron
commander,
wished
to
take
such
provisions
as
remained
at
Bogucharovo
before
the
French
could
get
them.
Rostov
and
Ilyin
were
in
the
merriest
of
moods.
On
the
way
to
Bogucharovo,
a
princely
estate
with
a
dwelling
house
and
farm
where
they
hoped
to
find
many
domestic
serfs
and
pretty
girls,
they
questioned
Lavrushka
about
Napoleon
and
laughed
at
his
stories,
and
raced
one
another
to
try
Ilyin's
horse.
Rostov
had
no
idea
that
the
village
he
was
entering
was
the
property
of
that
very
Bolkonski
who
had
been
engaged
to
his
sister.
Rostov
and
Ilyin
gave
rein
to
their
horses
for
a
last
race
along
the
incline
before
reaching
Bogucharovo,
and
Rostov,
outstripping
Ilyin,
was
the
first
to
gallop
into
the
village
street.
"You're
first!"
cried
Ilyin,
flushed.
"Yes,
always
first
both
on
the
grassland
and
here,"
answered
Rostov,
stroking
his
heated
Donets
horse.
"And
I'd
have
won
on
my
Frenchy,
your
excellency,"
said
Lavrushka
from
behind,
alluding
to
his
shabby
cart
horse,
"only
I
didn't
wish
to
mortify
you."
They
rode
at
a
footpace
to
the
barn,
where
a
large
crowd
of
peasants
was
standing.
Some
of
the
men
bared
their
heads,
others
stared
at
the
new
arrivals
without
doffing
their
caps.
Two
tall
old
peasants
with
wrinkled
faces
and
scanty
beards
emerged
from
the
tavern,
smiling,
staggering,
and
singing
some
incoherent
song,
and
approached
the
officers.
"Fine
fellows!"
said
Rostov
laughing.
"Is
there
any
hay
here?"
"And
how
like
one
another,"
said
Ilyin.
"A
mo-o-st
me-r-r-y
co-o-m-pa...!"
sang
one
of
the
peasants
with
a
blissful
smile.
One
of
the
men
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
went
up
to
Rostov.
"Who
do
you
belong
to?"
he
asked.
"The
French,"
replied
Ilyin
jestingly,
"and
here
is
Napoleon
himself"--
and
he
pointed
to
Lavrushka.
"Then
you
are
Russians?"
the
peasant
asked
again.
"And
is
there
a
large
force
of
you
here?"
said
another,
a
short
man,
coming
up.
"Very
large,"
answered
Rostov.
"But
why
have
you
collected
here?"
he
added.
"Is
it
a
holiday?"
"The
old
men
have
met
to
talk
over
the
business
of
the
commune,"
replied
the
peasant,
moving
away.
At
that
moment,
on
the
road
leading
from
the
big
house,
two
women
and
a
man
in
a
white
hat
were
seen
coming
toward
the
officers.
"The
one
in
pink
is
mine,
so
keep
off!"
said
Ilyin
on
seeing
Dunyasha
running
resolutely
toward
him.
"She'll
be
ours!"
said
Lavrushka
to
Ilyin,
winking.
"What
do
you
want,
my
pretty?"
said
Ilyin
with
a
smile.
"The
princess
ordered
me
to
ask
your
regiment
and
your
name."
"This
is
Count
Rostov,
squadron
commander,
and
I
am
your
humble
servant."
"Co-o-om-pa-ny!"
roared
the
tipsy
peasant
with
a
beatific
smile
as
he
looked
at
Ilyin
talking
to
the
girl.
Following
Dunyasha,
Alpatych
advanced
to
Rostov,
having
bared
his
head
while
still
at
a
distance.
"May
I
make
bold
to
trouble
your
honor?"
said
he
respectfully,
but
with
a
shade
of
contempt
for
the
youthfulness
of
this
officer
and
with
a
hand
thrust
into
his
bosom.
"My
mistress,
daughter
of
General
in
Chief
Prince
Nicholas
Bolkonski
who
died
on
the
fifteenth
of
this
month,
finding
herself
in
difficulties
owing
to
the
boorishness
of
these
people"--he
pointed
to
the
peasants--"asks
you
to
come
up
to
the
house....
Won't
you,
please,
ride
on
a
little
farther,"
said
Alpatych
with
a
melancholy
smile,
"as
it
is
not
convenient
in
the
presence
of...?"
He
pointed
to
the
two
peasants
who
kept
as
close
to
him
as
horseflies
to
a
horse.
"Ah!...
Alpatych...
Ah,
Yakov
Alpatych...
Grand!
Forgive
us
for
Christ's
sake,
eh?"
said
the
peasants,
smiling
joyfully
at
him.
Rostov
looked
at
the
tipsy
peasants
and
smiled.
"Or
perhaps
they
amuse
your
honor?"
remarked
Alpatych
with
a
staid
air,
as
he
pointed
at
the
old
men
with
his
free
hand.
"No,
there's
not
much
to
be
amused
at
here,"
said
Rostov,
and
rode
on
a
little
way.
"What's
the
matter?"
he
asked.
"I
make
bold
to
inform
your
honor
that
the
rude
peasants
here
don't
wish
to
let
the
mistress
leave
the
estate,
and
threaten
to
unharness
her
horses,
so
that
though
everything
has
been
packed
up
since
morning,
her
excellency
cannot
get
away."
"Impossible!"
exclaimed
Rostov.
"I
have
the
honor
to
report
to
you
the
actual
truth,"
said
Alpatych.
Rostov
dismounted,
gave
his
horse
to
the
orderly,
and
followed
Alpatych
to
the
house,
questioning
him
as
to
the
state
of
affairs.
It
appeared
that
the
princess'
offer
of
corn
to
the
peasants
the
previous
day,
and
her
talk
with
Dron
and
at
the
meeting,
had
actually
had
so
bad
an
effect
that
Dron
had
finally
given
up
the
keys
and
joined
the
peasants
and
had
not
appeared
when
Alpatych
sent
for
him;
and
that
in
the
morning
when
the
princess
gave
orders
to
harness
for
her
journey,
the
peasants
had
come
in
a
large
crowd
to
the
barn
and
sent
word
that
they
would
not
let
her
leave
the
village:
that
there
was
an
order
not
to
move,
and
that
they
would
unharness
the
horses.
Alpatych
had
gone
out
to
admonish
them,
but
was
told
(it
was
chiefly
Karp
who
did
the
talking,
Dron
not
showing
himself
in
the
crowd)
that
they
could
not
let
the
princess
go,
that
there
was
an
order
to
the
contrary,
but
that
if
she
stayed
they
would
serve
her
as
before
and
obey
her
in
everything.
At
the
moment
when
Rostov
and
Ilyin
were
galloping
along
the
road,
Princess
Mary,
despite
the
dissuasions
of
Alpatych,
her
nurse,
and
the
maids,
had
given
orders
to
harness
and
intended
to
start,
but
when
the
cavalrymen
were
espied
they
were
taken
for
Frenchmen,
the
coachman
ran
away,
and
the
women
in
the
house
began
to
wail.
"Father!
Benefactor!
God
has
sent
you!"
exclaimed
deeply
moved
voices
as
Rostov
passed
through
the
anteroom.
Princess
Mary
was
sitting
helpless
and
bewildered
in
the
large
sitting
room,
when
Rostov
was
shown
in.
She
could
not
grasp
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
come,
or
what
was
happening
to
her.
When
she
saw
his
Russian
face,
and
by
his
walk
and
the
first
words
he
uttered
recognized
him
as
a
man
of
her
own
class,
she
glanced
at
him
with
her
deep
radiant
look
and
began
speaking
in
a
voice
that
faltered
and
trembled
with
emotion.
This
meeting
immediately
struck
Rostov
as
a
romantic
event.
"A
helpless
girl
overwhelmed
with
grief,
left
to
the
mercy
of
coarse,
rioting
peasants!
And
what
a
strange
fate
sent
me
here!
What
gentleness
and
nobility
there
are
in
her
features
and
expression!"
thought
he
as
he
looked
at
her
and
listened
to
her
timid
story.
When
she
began
to
tell
him
that
all
this
had
happened
the
day
after
her
father's
funeral,
her
voice
trembled.
She
turned
away,
and
then,
as
if
fearing
he
might
take
her
words
as
meant
to
move
him
to
pity,
looked
at
him
with
an
apprehensive
glance
of
inquiry.
There
were
tears
in
Rostov's
eyes.
Princess
Mary
noticed
this
and
glanced
gratefully
at
him
with
that
radiant
look
which
caused
the
plainness
of
her
face
to
be
forgotten.
"I
cannot
express,
Princess,
how
glad
I
am
that
I
happened
to
ride
here
and
am
able
to
show
my
readiness
to
serve
you,"
said
Rostov,
rising.
"Go
when
you
please,
and
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
no
one
shall
dare
to
cause
you
annoyance
if
only
you
will
allow
me
to
act
as
your
escort."
And
bowing
respectfully,
as
if
to
a
lady
of
royal
blood,
he
moved
toward
the
door.
Rostov's
deferential
tone
seemed
to
indicate
that
though
he
would
consider
himself
happy
to
be
acquainted
with
her,
he
did
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
her
misfortunes
to
intrude
upon
her.
Princess
Mary
understood
this
and
appreciated
his
delicacy.
"I
am
very,
very
grateful
to
you,"
she
said
in
French,
"but
I
hope
it
was
all
a
misunderstanding
and
that
no
one
is
to
blame
for
it."
She
suddenly
began
to
cry.
"Excuse
me!"
she
said.
Rostov,
knitting
his
brows,
left
the
room
with
another
low
bow.
CHAPTER
XIV
"Well,
is
she
pretty?
Ah,
friend--my
pink
one
is
delicious;
her
name
is
Dunyasha...."
But
on
glancing
at
Rostov's
face
Ilyin
stopped
short.
He
saw
that
his
hero
and
commander
was
following
quite
a
different
train
of
thought.
Rostov
glanced
angrily
at
Ilyin
and
without
replying
strode
off
with
rapid
steps
to
the
village.
"I'll
show
them;
I'll
give
it
to
them,
the
brigands!"
said
he
to
himself.
Alpatych
at
a
gliding
trot,
only
just
managing
not
to
run,
kept
up
with
him
with
difficulty.
"What
decision
have
you
been
pleased
to
come
to?"
said
he.
Rostov
stopped
and,
clenching
his
fists,
suddenly
and
sternly
turned
on
Alpatych.
"Decision?
What
decision?
Old
dotard!..."
cried
he.
"What
have
you
been
about?
Eh?
The
peasants
are
rioting,
and
you
can't
manage
them?
You're
a
traitor
yourself!
I
know
you.
I'll
flay
you
all
alive!..."
And
as
if
afraid
of
wasting
his
store
of
anger,
he
left
Alpatych
and
went
rapidly
forward.
Alpatych,
mastering
his
offended
feelings,
kept
pace
with
Rostov
at
a
gliding
gait
and
continued
to
impart
his
views.
He
said
the
peasants
were
obdurate
and
that
at
the
present
moment
it
would
be
imprudent
to
"overresist"
them
without
an
armed
force,
and
would
it
not
be
better
first
to
send
for
the
military?
"I'll
give
them
armed
force...
I'll
'overresist'
them!"
uttered
Rostov
meaninglessly,
breathless
with
irrational
animal
fury
and
the
need
to
vent
it.
Without
considering
what
he
would
do
he
moved
unconciously
with
quick,
resolute
steps
toward
the
crowd.
And
the
nearer
he
drew
to
it
the
more
Alpatych
felt
that
this
unreasonable
action
might
produce
good
results.
The
peasants
in
the
crowd
were
similarly
impressed
when
they
saw
Rostov's
rapid,
firm
steps
and
resolute,
frowning
face.
After
the
hussars
had
come
to
the
village
and
Rostov
had
gone
to
see
the
princess,
a
certain
confusion
and
dissension
had
arisen
among
the
crowd.
Some
of
the
peasants
said
that
these
new
arrivals
were
Russians
and
might
take
it
amiss
that
the
mistress
was
being
detained.
Dron
was
of
this
opinion,
but
as
soon
as
he
expressed
it
Karp
and
others
attacked
their
ex-Elder.
"How
many
years
have
you
been
fattening
on
the
commune?"
Karp
shouted
at
him.
"It's
all
one
to
you!
You'll
dig
up
your
pot
of
money
and
take
it
away
with
you....
What
does
it
matter
to
you
whether
our
homes
are
ruined
or
not?"
"We've
been
told
to
keep
order,
and
that
no
one
is
to
leave
their
homes
or
take
away
a
single
grain,
and
that's
all
about
it!"
cried
another.
"It
was
your
son's
turn
to
be
conscripted,
but
no
fear!
You
begrudged
your
lump
of
a
son,"
a
little
old
man
suddenly
began
attacking
Dron--
"and
so
they
took
my
Vanka
to
be
shaved
for
a
soldier!
But
we
all
have
to
die."
"To
be
sure,
we
all
have
to
die.
I'm
not
against
the
commune,"
said
Dron.
"That's
it--not
against
it!
You've
filled
your
belly...."
The
two
tall
peasants
had
their
say.
As
soon
as
Rostov,
followed
by
Ilyin,
Lavrushka,
and
Alpatych,
came
up
to
the
crowd,
Karp,
thrusting
his
fingers
into
his
belt
and
smiling
a
little,
walked
to
the
front.
Dron
on
the
contrary
retired
to
the
rear
and
the
crowd
drew
closer
together.
"Who
is
your
Elder
here?
Hey?"
shouted
Rostov,
coming
up
to
the
crowd
with
quick
steps.
"The
Elder?
What
do
you
want
with
him?..."
asked
Karp.
But
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth,
his
cap
flew
off
and
a
fierce
blow
jerked
his
head
to
one
side.
"Caps
off,
traitors!"
shouted
Rostov
in
a
wrathful
voice.
"Where's
the
Elder?"
he
cried
furiously.
"The
Elder....
He
wants
the
Elder!...
Dron
Zakharych,
you!"
meek
and
flustered
voices
here
and
there
were
heard
calling
and
caps
began
to
come
off
their
heads.
"We
don't
riot,
we're
following
the
orders,"
declared
Karp,
and
at
that
moment
several
voices
began
speaking
together.
"It's
as
the
old
men
have
decided--there's
too
many
of
you
giving
orders."
"Arguing?
Mutiny!...
Brigands!
Traitors!"
cried
Rostov
unmeaningly
in
a
voice
not
his
own,
gripping
Karp
by
the
collar.
"Bind
him,
bind
him!"
he
shouted,
though
there
was
no
one
to
bind
him
but
Lavrushka
and
Alpatych.
Lavrushka,
however,
ran
up
to
Karp
and
seized
him
by
the
arms
from
behind.
"Shall
I
call
up
our
men
from
beyond
the
hill?"
he
called
out.
Alpatych
turned
to
the
peasants
and
ordered
two
of
them
by
name
to
come
and
bind
Karp.
The
men
obediently
came
out
of
the
crowd
and
began
taking
off
their
belts.
"Where's
the
Elder?"
demanded
Rostov
in
a
loud
voice.
With
a
pale
and
frowning
face
Dron
stepped
out
of
the
crowd.
"Are
you
the
Elder?
Bind
him,
Lavrushka!"
shouted
Rostov,
as
if
that
order,
too,
could
not
possibly
meet
with
any
opposition.
And
in
fact
two
more
peasants
began
binding
Dron,
who
took
off
his
own
belt
and
handed
it
to
them,
as
if
to
aid
them.
"And
you
all
listen
to
me!"
said
Rostov
to
the
peasants.
"Be
off
to
your
houses
at
once,
and
don't
let
one
of
your
voices
be
heard!"
"Why,
we've
not
done
any
harm!
We
did
it
just
out
of
foolishness.
It's
all
nonsense...
I
said
then
that
it
was
not
in
order,"
voices
were
heard
bickering
with
one
another.
"There!
What
did
I
say?"
said
Alpatych,
coming
into
his
own
again.
"It's
wrong,
lads!"
"All
our
stupidity,
Yakov
Alpatych,"
came
the
answers,
and
the
crowd
began
at
once
to
disperse
through
the
village.
The
two
bound
men
were
led
off
to
the
master's
house.
The
two
drunken
peasants
followed
them.
"Aye,
when
I
look
at
you!..."
said
one
of
them
to
Karp.
"How
can
one
talk
to
the
masters
like
that?
What
were
you
thinking
of,
you
fool?"
added
the
other--"A
real
fool!"
Two
hours
later
the
carts
were
standing
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Bogucharovo
house.
The
peasants
were
briskly
carrying
out
the
proprietor's
goods
and
packing
them
on
the
carts,
and
Dron,
liberated
at
Princess
Mary's
wish
from
the
cupboard
where
he
had
been
confined,
was
standing
in
the
yard
directing
the
men.
"Don't
put
it
in
so
carelessly,"
said
one
of
the
peasants,
a
man
with
a
round
smiling
face,
taking
a
casket
from
a
housemaid.
"You
know
it
has
cost
money!
How
can
you
chuck
it
in
like
that
or
shove
it
under
the
cord
where
it'll
get
rubbed?
I
don't
like
that
way
of
doing
things.
Let
it
all
be
done
properly,
according
to
rule.
Look
here,
put
it
under
the
bast
matting
and
cover
it
with
hay--that's
the
way!"
"Eh,
books,
books!"
said
another
peasant,
bringing
out
Prince
Andrew's
library
cupboards.
"Don't
catch
up
against
it!
It's
heavy,
lads--solid
books."
"Yes,
they
worked
all
day
and
didn't
play!"
remarked
the
tall,
round-
faced
peasant
gravely,
pointing
with
a
significant
wink
at
the
dictionaries
that
were
on
the
top.
Unwilling
to
obtrude
himself
on
the
princess,
Rostov
did
not
go
back
to
the
house
but
remained
in
the
village
awaiting
her
departure.
When
her
carriage
drove
out
of
the
house,
he
mounted
and
accompanied
her
eight
miles
from
Bogucharovo
to
where
the
road
was
occupied
by
our
troops.
At
the
inn
at
Yankovo
he
respectfully
took
leave
of
her,
for
the
first
time
permitting
himself
to
kiss
her
hand.
"How
can
you
speak
so!"
he
blushingly
replied
to
Princess
Mary's
expressions
of
gratitude
for
her
deliverance,
as
she
termed
what
had
occurred.
"Any
police
officer
would
have
done
as
much!
If
we
had
had
only
peasants
to
fight,
we
should
not
have
let
the
enemy
come
so
far,"
said
he
with
a
sense
of
shame
and
wishing
to
change
the
subject.
"I
am
only
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
making
your
acquaintance.
Good-bye,
Princess.
I
wish
you
happiness
and
consolation
and
hope
to
meet
you
again
in
happier
circumstances.
If
you
don't
want
to
make
me
blush,
please
don't
thank
me!"
But
the
princess,
if
she
did
not
again
thank
him
in
words,
thanked
him
with
the
whole
expression
of
her
face,
radiant
with
gratitude
and
tenderness.
She
could
not
believe
that
there
was
nothing
to
thank
him
for.
On
the
contrary,
it
seemed
to
her
certain
that
had
he
not
been
there
she
would
have
perished
at
the
hands
of
the
mutineers
and
of
the
French,
and
that
he
had
exposed
himself
to
terrible
and
obvious
danger
to
save
her,
and
even
more
certain
was
it
that
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
and
noble
soul,
able
to
understand
her
position
and
her
sorrow.
His
kind,
honest
eyes,
with
the
tears
rising
in
them
when
she
herself
had
begun
to
cry
as
she
spoke
of
her
loss,
did
not
leave
her
memory.
When
she
had
taken
leave
of
him
and
remained
alone
she
suddenly
felt
her
eyes
filling
with
tears,
and
then
not
for
the
first
time
the
strange
question
presented
itself
to
her:
did
she
love
him?
On
the
rest
of
the
way
to
Moscow,
though
the
princess'
position
was
not
a
cheerful
one,
Dunyasha,
who
went
with
her
in
the
carriage,
more
than
once
noticed
that
her
mistress
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
smiled
at
something
with
an
expression
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow.
"Well,
supposing
I
do
love
him?"
thought
Princess
Mary.
Ashamed
as
she
was
of
acknowledging
to
herself
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
who
would
perhaps
never
love
her,
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
no
one
would
ever
know
it
and
that
she
would
not
be
to
blame
if,
without
ever
speaking
of
it
to
anyone,
she
continued
to
the
end
of
her
life
to
love
the
man
with
whom
she
had
fallen
in
love
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
her
life.
Sometimes
when
she
recalled
his
looks,
his
sympathy,
and
his
words,
happiness
did
not
appear
impossible
to
her.
It
was
at
those
moments
that
Dunyasha
noticed
her
smiling
as
she
looked
out
of
the
carriage
window.
"Was
it
not
fate
that
brought
him
to
Bogucharovo,
and
at
that
very
moment?"
thought
Princess
Mary.
"And
that
caused
his
sister
to
refuse
my
brother?"
And
in
all
this
Princess
Mary
saw
the
hand
of
Providence.
The
impression
the
princess
made
on
Rostov
was
a
very
agreeable
one.
To
remember
her
gave
him
pleasure,
and
when
his
comrades,
hearing
of
his
adventure
at
Bogucharovo,
rallied
him
on
having
gone
to
look
for
hay
and
having
picked
up
one
of
the
wealthiest
heiresses
in
Russia,
he
grew
angry.
It
made
him
angry
just
because
the
idea
of
marrying
the
gentle
Princess
Mary,
who
was
attractive
to
him
and
had
an
enormous
fortune,
had
against
his
will
more
than
once
entered
his
head.
For
himself
personally
Nicholas
could
not
wish
for
a
better
wife:
by
marrying
her
he
would
make
the
countess
his
mother
happy,
would
be
able
to
put
his
father's
affairs
in
order,
and
would
even--he
felt
it--ensure
Princess
Mary's
happiness.
But
Sonya?
And
his
plighted
word?
That
was
why
Rostov
grew
angry
when
he
was
rallied
about
Princess
Bolkonskaya.
CHAPTER
XV
On
receiving
command
of
the
armies
Kutuzov
remembered
Prince
Andrew
and
sent
an
order
for
him
to
report
at
headquarters.
Prince
Andrew
arrived
at
Tsarevo-Zaymishche
on
the
very
day
and
at
the
very
hour
that
Kutuzov
was
reviewing
the
troops
for
the
first
time.
He
stopped
in
the
village
at
the
priest's
house
in
front
of
which
stood
the
commander-in-chief's
carriage,
and
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
at
the
gate
awaiting
his
Serene
Highness,
as
everyone
now
called
Kutuzov.
From
the
field
beyond
the
village
came
now
sounds
of
regimental
music
and
now
the
roar
of
many
voices
shouting
"Hurrah!"
to
the
new
commander-in-chief.
Two
orderlies,
a
courier
and
a
major-domo,
stood
near
by,
some
ten
paces
from
Prince
Andrew,
availing
themselves
of
Kutuzov's
absence
and
of
the
fine
weather.
A
short,
swarthy
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
with
thick
mustaches
and
whiskers
rode
up
to
the
gate
and,
glancing
at
Prince
Andrew,
inquired
whether
his
Serene
Highness
was
putting
up
there
and
whether
he
would
soon
be
back.
Prince
Andrew
replied
that
he
was
not
on
his
Serene
Highness'
staff
but
was
himself
a
new
arrival.
The
lieutenant
colonel
turned
to
a
smart
orderly,
who,
with
the
peculiar
contempt
with
which
a
commander-in-
chief's
orderly
speaks
to
officers,
replied:
"What?
His
Serene
Highness?
I
expect
he'll
be
here
soon.
What
do
you
want?"
The
lieutenant
colonel
of
hussars
smiled
beneath
his
mustache
at
the
orderly's
tone,
dismounted,
gave
his
horse
to
a
dispatch
runner,
and
approached
Bolkonski
with
a
slight
bow.
Bolkonski
made
room
for
him
on
the
bench
and
the
lieutenant
colonel
sat
down
beside
him.
"You're
also
waiting
for
the
commander-in-chief?"
said
he.
"They
say
he
weceives
evewyone,
thank
God!...
It's
awful
with
those
sausage
eaters!
Ermolov
had
weason
to
ask
to
be
pwomoted
to
be
a
German!
Now
p'waps
Wussians
will
get
a
look
in.
As
it
was,
devil
only
knows
what
was
happening.
We
kept
wetweating
and
wetweating.
Did
you
take
part
in
the
campaign?"
he
asked.
"I
had
the
pleasure,"
replied
Prince
Andrew,
"not
only
of
taking
part
in
the
retreat
but
of
losing
in
that
retreat
all
I
held
dear--not
to
mention
the
estate
and
home
of
my
birth--my
father,
who
died
of
grief.
I
belong
to
the
province
of
Smolensk."
"Ah?
You're
Pwince
Bolkonski?
Vewy
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance!
I'm
Lieutenant
Colonel
Denisov,
better
known
as
'Vaska,'"
said
Denisov,
pressing
Prince
Andrew's
hand
and
looking
into
his
face
with
a
particularly
kindly
attention.
"Yes,
I
heard,"
said
he
sympathetically,
and
after
a
short
pause
added:
"Yes,
it's
Scythian
warfare.
It's
all
vewy
well--only
not
for
those
who
get
it
in
the
neck.
So
you
are
Pwince
Andwew
Bolkonski?"
He
swayed
his
head.
"Vewy
pleased,
Pwince,
to
make
your
acquaintance!"
he
repeated
again,
smiling
sadly,
and
he
again
pressed
Prince
Andrew's
hand.
Prince
Andrew
knew
Denisov
from
what
Natasha
had
told
him
of
her
first
suitor.
This
memory
carried
him
sadly
and
sweetly
back
to
those
painful
feelings
of
which
he
had
not
thought
lately,
but
which
still
found
place
in
his
soul.
Of
late
he
had
received
so
many
new
and
very
serious
impressions--such
as
the
retreat
from
Smolensk,
his
visit
to
Bald
Hills,
and
the
recent
news
of
his
father's
death--and
had
experienced
so
many
emotions,
that
for
a
long
time
past
those
memories
had
not
entered
his
mind,
and
now
that
they
did,
they
did
not
act
on
him
with
nearly
their
former
strength.
For
Denisov,
too,
the
memories
awakened
by
the
name
of
Bolkonski
belonged
to
a
distant,
romantic
past,
when
after
supper
and
after
Natasha's
singing
he
had
proposed
to
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing.
He
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
that
time
and
of
his
love
for
Natasha,
and
passed
at
once
to
what
now
interested
him
passionately
and
exclusively.
This
was
a
plan
of
campaign
he
had
devised
while
serving
at
the
outposts
during
the
retreat.
He
had
proposed
that
plan
to
Barclay
de
Tolly
and
now
wished
to
propose
it
to
Kutuzov.
The
plan
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
French
line
of
operation
was
too
extended,
and
it
proposed
that
instead
of,
or
concurrently
with,
action
on
the
front
to
bar
the
advance
of
the
French,
we
should
attack
their
line
of
communication.
He
began
explaining
his
plan
to
Prince
Andrew.
"They
can't
hold
all
that
line.
It's
impossible.
I
will
undertake
to
bweak
thwough.
Give
me
five
hundwed
men
and
I
will
bweak
the
line,
that's
certain!
There's
only
one
way--guewilla
warfare!"
Denisov
rose
and
began
gesticulating
as
he
explained
his
plan
to
Bolkonski.
In
the
midst
of
his
explanation
shouts
were
heard
from
the
army,
growing
more
incoherent
and
more
diffused,
mingling
with
music
and
songs
and
coming
from
the
field
where
the
review
was
held.
Sounds
of
hoofs
and
shouts
were
nearing
the
village.
"He's
coming!
He's
coming!"
shouted
a
Cossack
standing
at
the
gate.
Bolkonski
and
Denisov
moved
to
the
gate,
at
which
a
knot
of
soldiers
(a
guard
of
honor)
was
standing,
and
they
saw
Kutuzov
coming
down
the
street
mounted
on
a
rather
small
sorrel
horse.
A
huge
suite
of
generals
rode
behind
him.
Barclay
was
riding
almost
beside
him,
and
a
crowd
of
officers
ran
after
and
around
them
shouting,
"Hurrah!"
His
adjutants
galloped
into
the
yard
before
him.
Kutuzov
was
impatiently
urging
on
his
horse,
which
ambled
smoothly
under
his
weight,
and
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
white
Horse
Guard's
cap
with
a
red
band
and
no
peak,
nodding
his
head
continually.
When
he
came
up
to
the
guard
of
honor,
a
fine
set
of
Grenadiers
mostly
wearing
decorations,
who
were
giving
him
the
salute,
he
looked
at
them
silently
and
attentively
for
nearly
a
minute
with
the
steady
gaze
of
a
commander
and
then
turned
to
the
crowd
of
generals
and
officers
surrounding
him.
Suddenly
his
face
assumed
a
subtle
expression,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
perplexity.
"And
with
such
fine
fellows
to
retreat
and
retreat!
Well,
good-by,
General,"
he
added,
and
rode
into
the
yard
past
Prince
Andrew
and
Denisov.
"Hurrah!
hurrah!
hurrah!"
shouted
those
behind
him.
Since
Prince
Andrew
had
last
seen
him
Kutuzov
had
grown
still
more
corpulent,
flaccid,
and
fat.
But
the
bleached
eyeball,
the
scar,
and
the
familiar
weariness
of
his
expression
were
still
the
same.
He
was
wearing
the
white
Horse
Guard's
cap
and
a
military
overcoat
with
a
whip
hanging
over
his
shoulder
by
a
thin
strap.
He
sat
heavily
and
swayed
limply
on
his
brisk
little
horse.
"Whew...
whew...
whew!"
he
whistled
just
audibly
as
he
rode
into
the
yard.
His
face
expressed
the
relief
of
relaxed
strain
felt
by
a
man
who
means
to
rest
after
a
ceremony.
He
drew
his
left
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
and,
lurching
with
his
whole
body
and
puckering
his
face
with
the
effort,
raised
it
with
difficulty
onto
the
saddle,
leaned
on
his
knee,
groaned,
and
slipped
down
into
the
arms
of
the
Cossacks
and
adjutants
who
stood
ready
to
assist
him.
He
pulled
himself
together,
looked
round,
screwing
up
his
eyes,
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew,
and,
evidently
not
recognizing
him,
moved
with
his
waddling
gait
to
the
porch.
"Whew...
whew...
whew!"
he
whistled,
and
again
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew.
As
often
occurs
with
old
men,
it
was
only
after
some
seconds
that
the
impression
produced
by
Prince
Andrew's
face
linked
itself
up
with
Kutuzov's
remembrance
of
his
personality.
"Ah,
how
do
you
do,
my
dear
prince?
How
do
you
do,
my
dear
boy?
Come
along..."
said
he,
glancing
wearily
round,
and
he
stepped
onto
the
porch
which
creaked
under
his
weight.
He
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
in
the
porch.
"And
how's
your
father?"
"I
received
news
of
his
death,
yesterday,"
replied
Prince
Andrew
abruptly.
Kutuzov
looked
at
him
with
eyes
wide
open
with
dismay
and
then
took
off
his
cap
and
crossed
himself:
"May
the
kingdom
of
Heaven
be
his!
God's
will
be
done
to
us
all!"
He
sighed
deeply,
his
whole
chest
heaving,
and
was
silent
for
a
while.
"I
loved
him
and
respected
him,
and
sympathize
with
you
with
all
my
heart."
He
embraced
Prince
Andrew,
pressing
him
to
his
fat
breast,
and
for
some
time
did
not
let
him
go.
When
he
released
him
Prince
Andrew
saw
that
Kutuzov's
flabby
lips
were
trembling
and
that
tears
were
in
his
eyes.
He
sighed
and
pressed
on
the
bench
with
both
hands
to
raise
himself.
"Come!
Come
with
me,
we'll
have
a
talk,"
said
he.
But
at
that
moment
Denisov,
no
more
intimidated
by
his
superiors
than
by
the
enemy,
came
with
jingling
spurs
up
the
steps
of
the
porch,
despite
the
angry
whispers
of
the
adjutants
who
tried
to
stop
him.
Kutuzov,
his
hands
still
pressed
on
the
seat,
glanced
at
him
glumly.
Denisov,
having
given
his
name,
announced
that
he
had
to
communicate
to
his
Serene
Highness
a
matter
of
great
importance
for
their
country's
welfare.
Kutuzov
looked
wearily
at
him
and,
lifting
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
annoyance,
folded
them
across
his
stomach,
repeating
the
words:
"For
our
country's
welfare?
Well,
what
is
it?
Speak!"
Denisov
blushed
like
a
girl
(it
was
strange
to
see
the
color
rise
in
that
shaggy,
bibulous,
time-
worn
face)
and
boldly
began
to
expound
his
plan
of
cutting
the
enemy's
lines
of
communication
between
Smolensk
and
Vyazma.
Denisov
came
from
those
parts
and
knew
the
country
well.
His
plan
seemed
decidedly
a
good
one,
especially
from
the
strength
of
conviction
with
which
he
spoke.
Kutuzov
looked
down
at
his
own
legs,
occasionally
glancing
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
hut
as
if
expecting
something
unpleasant
to
emerge
from
it.
And
from
that
hut,
while
Denisov
was
speaking,
a
general
with
a
portfolio
under
his
arm
really
did
appear.
"What?"
said
Kutuzov,
in
the
midst
of
Denisov's
explanations,
"are
you
ready
so
soon?"
"Ready,
your
Serene
Highness,"
replied
the
general.
Kutuzov
swayed
his
head,
as
much
as
to
say:
"How
is
one
man
to
deal
with
it
all?"
and
again
listened
to
Denisov.
"I
give
my
word
of
honor
as
a
Wussian
officer,"
said
Denisov,
"that
I
can
bweak
Napoleon's
line
of
communication!"
"What
relation
are
you
to
Intendant
General
Kiril
Andreevich
Denisov?"
asked
Kutuzov,
interrupting
him.
"He
is
my
uncle,
your
Sewene
Highness."
"Ah,
we
were
friends,"
said
Kutuzov
cheerfully.
"All
right,
all
right,
friend,
stay
here
at
the
staff
and
tomorrow
we'll
have
a
talk."
With
a
nod
to
Denisov
he
turned
away
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
papers
Konovnitsyn
had
brought
him.
"Would
not
your
Serene
Highness
like
to
come
inside?"
said
the
general
on
duty
in
a
discontented
voice,
"the
plans
must
be
examined
and
several
papers
have
to
be
signed."
An
adjutant
came
out
and
announced
that
everything
was
in
readiness
within.
But
Kutuzov
evidently
did
not
wish
to
enter
that
room
till
he
was
disengaged.
He
made
a
grimace...
"No,
tell
them
to
bring
a
small
table
out
here,
my
dear
boy.
I'll
look
at
them
here,"
said
he.
"Don't
go
away,"
he
added,
turning
to
Prince
Andrew,
who
remained
in
the
porch
and
listened
to
the
general's
report.
While
this
was
being
given,
Prince
Andrew
heard
the
whisper
of
a
woman's
voice
and
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
behind
the
door.
Several
times
on
glancing
that
way
he
noticed
behind
that
door
a
plump,
rosy,
handsome
woman
in
a
pink
dress
with
a
lilac
silk
kerchief
on
her
head,
holding
a
dish
and
evidently
awaiting
the
entrance
of
the
commander-in-chief.
Kutuzov's
adjutant
whispered
to
Prince
Andrew
that
this
was
the
wife
of
the
priest
whose
home
it
was,
and
that
she
intended
to
offer
his
Serene
Highness
bread
and
salt.
"Her
husband
has
welcomed
his
Serene
Highness
with
the
cross
at
the
church,
and
she
intends
to
welcome
him
in
the
house....
She's
very
pretty,"
added
the
adjutant
with
a
smile.
At
those
words
Kutuzov
looked
round.
He
was
listening
to
the
general's
report--
which
consisted
chiefly
of
a
criticism
of
the
position
at
Tsarevo-
Zaymishche--as
he
had
listened
to
Denisov,
and
seven
years
previously
had
listened
to
the
discussion
at
the
Austerlitz
council
of
war.
He
evidently
listened
only
because
he
had
ears
which,
though
there
was
a
piece
of
tow
in
one
of
them,
could
not
help
hearing;
but
it
was
evident
that
nothing
the
general
could
say
would
surprise
or
even
interest
him,
that
he
knew
all
that
would
be
said
beforehand,
and
heard
it
all
only
because
he
had
to,
as
one
has
to
listen
to
the
chanting
of
a
service
of
prayer.
All
that
Denisov
had
said
was
clever
and
to
the
point.
What
the
general
was
saying
was
even
more
clever
and
to
the
point,
but
it
was
evident
that
Kutuzov
despised
knowledge
and
cleverness,
and
knew
of
something
else
that
would
decide
the
matter--something
independent
of
cleverness
and
knowledge.
Prince
Andrew
watched
the
commander-in-chief's
face
attentively,
and
the
only
expression
he
could
see
there
was
one
of
boredom,
curiosity
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
feminine
whispering
behind
the
door,
and
a
desire
to
observe
propriety.
It
was
evident
that
Kutuzov
despised
cleverness
and
learning
and
even
the
patriotic
feeling
shown
by
Denisov,
but
despised
them
not
because
of
his
own
intellect,
feelings,
or
knowledge--he
did
not
try
to
display
any
of
these--but
because
of
something
else.
He
despised
them
because
of
his
old
age
and
experience
of
life.
The
only
instruction
Kutuzov
gave
of
his
own
accord
during
that
report
referred
to
looting
by
the
Russian
troops.
At
the
end
of
the
report
the
general
put
before
him
for
signature
a
paper
relating
to
the
recovery
of
payment
from
army
commanders
for
green
oats
mown
down
by
the
soldiers,
when
landowners
lodged
petitions
for
compensation.
After
hearing
the
matter,
Kutuzov
smacked
his
lips
together
and
shook
his
head.
"Into
the
stove...
into
the
fire
with
it!
I
tell
you
once
for
all,
my
dear
fellow,"
said
he,
"into
the
fire
with
all
such
things!
Let
them
cut
the
crops
and
burn
wood
to
their
hearts'
content.
I
don't
order
it
or
allow
it,
but
I
don't
exact
compensation
either.
One
can't
get
on
without
it.
'When
wood
is
chopped
the
chips
will
fly.'"
He
looked
at
the
paper
again.
"Oh,
this
German
precision!"
he
muttered,
shaking
his
head.
CHAPTER
XVI
"Well,
that's
all!"
said
Kutuzov
as
he
signed
the
last
of
the
documents,
and
rising
heavily
and
smoothing
out
the
folds
in
his
fat
white
neck
he
moved
toward
the
door
with
a
more
cheerful
expression.
The
priest's
wife,
flushing
rosy
red,
caught
up
the
dish
she
had
after
all
not
managed
to
present
at
the
right
moment,
though
she
had
so
long
been
preparing
for
it,
and
with
a
low
bow
offered
it
to
Kutuzov.
He
screwed
up
his
eyes,
smiled,
lifted
her
chin
with
his
hand,
and
said:
"Ah,
what
a
beauty!
Thank
you,
sweetheart!"
He
took
some
gold
pieces
from
his
trouser
pocket
and
put
them
on
the
dish
for
her.
"Well,
my
dear,
and
how
are
we
getting
on?"
he
asked,
moving
to
the
door
of
the
room
assigned
to
him.
The
priest's
wife
smiled,
and
with
dimples
in
her
rosy
cheeks
followed
him
into
the
room.
The
adjutant
came
out
to
the
porch
and
asked
Prince
Andrew
to
lunch
with
him.
Half
an
hour
later
Prince
Andrew
was
again
called
to
Kutuzov.
He
found
him
reclining
in
an
armchair,
still
in
the
same
unbuttoned
overcoat.
He
had
in
his
hand
a
French
book
which
he
closed
as
Prince
Andrew
entered,
marking
the
place
with
a
knife.
Prince
Andrew
saw
by
the
cover
that
it
was
Les
Chevaliers
du
Cygne
by
Madame
de
Genlis.
"Well,
sit
down,
sit
down
here.
Let's
have
a
talk,"
said
Kutuzov.
"It's
sad,
very
sad.
But
remember,
my
dear
fellow,
that
I
am
a
father
to
you,
a
second
father...."
Prince
Andrew
told
Kutuzov
all
he
knew
of
his
father's
death,
and
what
he
had
seen
at
Bald
Hills
when
he
passed
through
it.
"What...
what
they
have
brought
us
to!"
Kutuzov
suddenly
cried
in
an
agitated
voice,
evidently
picturing
vividly
to
himself
from
Prince
Andrew's
story
the
condition
Russia
was
in.
"But
give
me
time,
give
me
time!"
he
said
with
a
grim
look,
evidently
not
wishing
to
continue
this
agitating
conversation,
and
added:
"I
sent
for
you
to
keep
you
with
me."
"I
thank
your
Serene
Highness,
but
I
fear
I
am
no
longer
fit
for
the
staff,"
replied
Prince
Andrew
with
a
smile
which
Kutuzov
noticed.
Kutuzov
glanced
inquiringly
at
him.
"But
above
all,"
added
Prince
Andrew,
"I
have
grown
used
to
my
regiment,
am
fond
of
the
officers,
and
I
fancy
the
men
also
like
me.
I
should
be
sorry
to
leave
the
regiment.
If
I
decline
the
honor
of
being
with
you,
believe
me..."
A
shrewd,
kindly,
yet
subtly
derisive
expression
lit
up
Kutuzov's
podgy
face.
He
cut
Bolkonski
short.
"I
am
sorry,
for
I
need
you.
But
you're
right,
you're
right!
It's
not
here
that
men
are
needed.
Advisers
are
always
plentiful,
but
men
are
not.
The
regiments
would
not
be
what
they
are
if
the
would-be
advisers
served
there
as
you
do.
I
remember
you
at
Austerlitz....
I
remember,
yes,
I
remember
you
with
the
standard!"
said
Kutuzov,
and
a
flush
of
pleasure
suffused
Prince
Andrew's
face
at
this
recollection.
Taking
his
hand
and
drawing
him
downwards,
Kutuzov
offered
his
cheek
to
be
kissed,
and
again
Prince
Andrew
noticed
tears
in
the
old
man's
eyes.
Though
Prince
Andrew
knew
that
Kutuzov's
tears
came
easily,
and
that
he
was
particularly
tender
to
and
considerate
of
him
from
a
wish
to
show
sympathy
with
his
loss,
yet
this
reminder
of
Austerlitz
was
both
pleasant
and
flattering
to
him.
"Go
your
way
and
God
be
with
you.
I
know
your
path
is
the
path
of
honor!"
He
paused.
"I
missed
you
at
Bucharest,
but
I
needed
someone
to
send."
And
changing
the
subject,
Kutuzov
began
to
speak
of
the
Turkish
war
and
the
peace
that
had
been
concluded.
"Yes,
I
have
been
much
blamed,"
he
said,
"both
for
that
war
and
the
peace...
but
everything
came
at
the
right
time.
Tout
vient
a
point
a
celui
qui
sait
attendre.
*
And
there
were
as
many
advisers
there
as
here..."
he
went
on,
returning
to
the
subject
of
"advisers"
which
evidently
occupied
him.
"Ah,
those
advisers!"
said
he.
"If
we
had
listened
to
them
all
we
should
not
have
made
peace
with
Turkey
and
should
not
have
been
through
with
that
war.
Everything
in
haste,
but
more
haste,
less
speed.
Kamenski
would
have
been
lost
if
he
had
not
died.
He
stormed
fortresses
with
thirty
thousand
men.
It
is
not
difficult
to
capture
a
fortress
but
it
is
difficult
to
win
a
campaign.
For
that,
not
storming
and
attacking
but
patience
and
time
are
wanted.
Kamenski
sent
soldiers
to
Rustchuk,
but
I
only
employed
these
two
things
and
took
more
fortresses
than
Kamenski
and
made
them
Turks
eat
horseflesh!"
He
swayed
his
head.
"And
the
French
shall
too,
believe
me,"
he
went
on,
growing
warmer
and
beating
his
chest,
"I'll
make
them
eat
horseflesh!"
And
tears
again
dimmed
his
eyes.
*
"Everything
comes
in
time
to
him
who
knows
how
to
wait."
"But
shan't
we
have
to
accept
battle?"
remarked
Prince
Andrew.
"We
shall
if
everybody
wants
it;
it
can't
be
helped....
But
believe
me,
my
dear
boy,
there
is
nothing
stronger
than
those
two:
patience
and
time,
they
will
do
it
all.
But
the
advisers
n'entendent
pas
de
cette
oreille,
voila
le
mal.
*
Some
want
a
thing--others
don't.
What's
one
to
do?"
he
asked,
evidently
expecting
an
answer.
"Well,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?"
he
repeated
and
his
eye
shone
with
a
deep,
shrewd
look.
"I'll
tell
you
what
to
do,"
he
continued,
as
Prince
Andrew
still
did
not
reply:
"I
will
tell
you
what
to
do,
and
what
I
do.
Dans
le
doute,
mon
cher,"
he
paused,
"abstiens-toi"
*(2)--he
articulated
the
French
proverb
deliberately.
*
"Don't
see
it
that
way,
that's
the
trouble."
*
(2)
"When
in
doubt,
my
dear
fellow,
do
nothing."
"Well,
good-by,
my
dear
fellow;
remember
that
with
all
my
heart
I
share
your
sorrow,
and
that
for
you
I
am
not
a
Serene
Highness,
nor
a
prince,
nor
a
commander-in-chief,
but
a
father!
If
you
want
anything
come
straight
to
me.
Good-bye,
my
dear
boy."
Again
he
embraced
and
kissed
Prince
Andrew,
but
before
the
latter
had
left
the
room
Kutuzov
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
went
on
with
his
unfinished
novel,
Les
Chevaliers
du
Cygne
by
Madame
de
Genlis.
Prince
Andrew
could
not
have
explained
how
or
why
it
was,
but
after
that
interview
with
Kutuzov
he
went
back
to
his
regiment
reassured
as
to
the
general
course
of
affairs
and
as
to
the
man
to
whom
it
had
been
entrusted.
The
more
he
realized
the
absence
of
all
personal
motive
in
that
old
man--in
whom
there
seemed
to
remain
only
the
habit
of
passions,
and
in
place
of
an
intellect
(grouping
events
and
drawing
conclusions)
only
the
capacity
calmly
to
contemplate
the
course
of
events--the
more
reassured
he
was
that
everything
would
be
as
it
should.
"He
will
not
bring
in
any
plan
of
his
own.
He
will
not
devise
or
undertake
anything,"
thought
Prince
Andrew,
"but
he
will
hear
everything,
remember
everything,
and
put
everything
in
its
place.
He
will
not
hinder
anything
useful
nor
allow
anything
harmful.
He
understands
that
there
is
something
stronger
and
more
important
than
his
own
will--the
inevitable
course
of
events,
and
he
can
see
them
and
grasp
their
significance,
and
seeing
that
significance
can
refrain
from
meddling
and
renounce
his
personal
wish
directed
to
something
else.
And
above
all,"
thought
Prince
Andrew,
"one
believes
in
him
because
he's
Russian,
despite
the
novel
by
Genlis
and
the
French
proverbs,
and
because
his
voice
shook
when
he
said:
'What
they
have
brought
us
to!'
and
had
a
sob
in
it
when
he
said
he
would
'make
them
eat
horseflesh!'"
On
such
feelings,
more
or
less
dimly
shared
by
all,
the
unanimity
and
general
approval
were
founded
with
which,
despite
court
influences,
the
popular
choice
of
Kutuzov
as
commander-in-chief
was
received.
CHAPTER
XVII
After
the
Emperor
had
left
Moscow,
life
flowed
on
there
in
its
usual
course,
and
its
course
was
so
very
usual
that
it
was
difficult
to
remember
the
recent
days
of
patriotic
elation
and
ardor,
hard
to
believe
that
Russia
was
really
in
danger
and
that
the
members
of
the
English
Club
were
also
sons
of
the
Fatherland
ready
to
sacrifice
everything
for
it.
The
one
thing
that
recalled
the
patriotic
fervor
everyone
had
displayed
during
the
Emperor's
stay
was
the
call
for
contributions
of
men
and
money,
a
necessity
that
as
soon
as
the
promises
had
been
made
assumed
a
legal,
official
form
and
became
unavoidable.
With
the
enemy's
approach
to
Moscow,
the
Moscovites'
view
of
their
situation
did
not
grow
more
serious
but
on
the
contrary
became
even
more
frivolous,
as
always
happens
with
people
who
see
a
great
danger
approaching.
At
the
approach
of
danger
there
are
always
two
voices
that
speak
with
equal
power
in
the
human
soul:
one
very
reasonably
tells
a
man
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
danger
and
the
means
of
escaping
it;
the
other,
still
more
reasonably,
says
that
it
is
too
depressing
and
painful
to
think
of
the
danger,
since
it
is
not
in
man's
power
to
foresee
everything
and
avert
the
general
course
of
events,
and
it
is
therefore
better
to
disregard
what
is
painful
till
it
comes,
and
to
think
about
what
is
pleasant.
In
solitude
a
man
generally
listens
to
the
first
voice,
but
in
society
to
the
second.
So
it
was
now
with
the
inhabitants
of
Moscow.
It
was
long
since
people
had
been
as
gay
in
Moscow
as
that
year.
Rostopchin's
broadsheets,
headed
by
woodcuts
of
a
drink
shop,
a
potman,
and
a
Moscow
burgher
called
Karpushka
Chigirin,
"who--having
been
a
militiaman
and
having
had
rather
too
much
at
the
pub--heard
that
Napoleon
wished
to
come
to
Moscow,
grew
angry,
abused
the
French
in
very
bad
language,
came
out
of
the
drink
shop,
and,
under
the
sign
of
the
eagle,
began
to
address
the
assembled
people,"
were
read
and
discussed,
together
with
the
latest
of
Vasili
Lvovich
Pushkin's
bouts
rimes.
In
the
corner
room
at
the
club,
members
gathered
to
read
these
broadsheets,
and
some
liked
the
way
Karpushka
jeered
at
the
French,
saying:
"They
will
swell
up
with
Russian
cabbage,
burst
with
our
buckwheat
porridge,
and
choke
themselves
with
cabbage
soup.
They
are
all
dwarfs
and
one
peasant
woman
will
toss
three
of
them
with
a
hayfork."
Others
did
not
like
that
tone
and
said
it
was
stupid
and
vulgar.
It
was
said
that
Rostopchin
had
expelled
all
Frenchmen
and
even
all
foreigners
from
Moscow,
and
that
there
had
been
some
spies
and
agents
of
Napoleon
among
them;
but
this
was
told
chiefly
to
introduce
Rostopchin's
witty
remark
on
that
occasion.
The
foreigners
were
deported
to
Nizhni
by
boat,
and
Rostopchin
had
said
to
them
in
French:
"Rentrez
en
vousmemes;
entrez
dans
la
barque,
et
n'en
faites
pas
une
barque
de
Charon."
*
There
was
talk
of
all
the
government
offices
having
been
already
removed
from
Moscow,
and
to
this
Shinshin's
witticism
was
added--that
for
that
alone
Moscow
ought
to
be
grateful
to
Napoleon.
It
was
said
that
Mamonov's
regiment
would
cost
him
eight
hundred
thousand
rubles,
and
that
Bezukhov
had
spent
even
more
on
his,
but
that
the
best
thing
about
Bezukhov's
action
was
that
he
himself
was
going
to
don
a
uniform
and
ride
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
without
charging
anything
for
the
show.
*
"Think
it
over;
get
into
the
barque,
and
take
care
not
to
make
it
a
barque
of
Charon."
"You
don't
spare
anyone,"
said
Julie
Drubetskaya
as
she
collected
and
pressed
together
a
bunch
of
raveled
lint
with
her
thin,
beringed
fingers.
Julie
was
preparing
to
leave
Moscow
next
day
and
was
giving
a
farewell
soiree.
"Bezukhov
est
ridicule,
but
he
is
so
kind
and
good-natured.
What
pleasure
is
there
to
be
so
caustique?"
"A
forfeit!"
cried
a
young
man
in
militia
uniform
whom
Julie
called
"mon
chevalier,"
and
who
was
going
with
her
to
Nizhni.
In
Julie's
set,
as
in
many
other
circles
in
Moscow,
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
would
speak
nothing
but
Russian
and
that
those
who
made
a
slip
and
spoke
French
should
pay
fines
to
the
Committee
of
Voluntary
Contributions.
"Another
forfeit
for
a
Gallicism,"
said
a
Russian
writer
who
was
present.
"'What
pleasure
is
there
to
be'
is
not
Russian!"
"You
spare
no
one,"
continued
Julie
to
the
young
man
without
heeding
the
author's
remark.
"For
caustique--I
am
guilty
and
will
pay,
and
I
am
prepared
to
pay
again
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
the
truth.
For
Gallicisms
I
won't
be
responsible,"
she
remarked,
turning
to
the
author:
"I
have
neither
the
money
nor
the
time,
like
Prince
Galitsyn,
to
engage
a
master
to
teach
me
Russian!"
"Ah,
here
he
is!"
she
added.
"Quand
on...
No,
no,"
she
said
to
the
militia
officer,
"you
won't
catch
me.
Speak
of
the
sun
and
you
see
its
rays!"
and
she
smiled
amiably
at
Pierre.
"We
were
just
talking
of
you,"
she
said
with
the
facility
in
lying
natural
to
a
society
woman.
"We
were
saying
that
your
regiment
would
be
sure
to
be
better
than
Mamonov's."
"Oh,
don't
talk
to
me
of
my
regiment,"
replied
Pierre,
kissing
his
hostess'
hand
and
taking
a
seat
beside
her.
"I
am
so
sick
of
it."
"You
will,
of
course,
command
it
yourself?"
said
Julie,
directing
a
sly,
sarcastic
glance
toward
the
militia
officer.
The
latter
in
Pierre's
presence
had
ceased
to
be
caustic,
and
his
face
expressed
perplexity
as
to
what
Julie's
smile
might
mean.
In
spite
of
his
absent-mindedness
and
good
nature,
Pierre's
personality
immediately
checked
any
attempt
to
ridicule
him
to
his
face.
"No,"
said
Pierre,
with
a
laughing
glance
at
his
big,
stout
body.
"I
should
make
too
good
a
target
for
the
French,
besides
I
am
afraid
I
should
hardly
be
able
to
climb
onto
a
horse."
Among
those
whom
Julie's
guests
happened
to
choose
to
gossip
about
were
the
Rostovs.
"I
hear
that
their
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
way,"
said
Julie.
"And
he
is
so
unreasonable,
the
count
himself
I
mean.
The
Razumovskis
wanted
to
buy
his
house
and
his
estate
near
Moscow,
but
it
drags
on
and
on.
He
asks
too
much."
"No,
I
think
the
sale
will
come
off
in
a
few
days,"
said
someone.
"Though
it
is
madness
to
buy
anything
in
Moscow
now."
"Why?"
asked
Julie.
"You
don't
think
Moscow
is
in
danger?"
"Then
why
are
you
leaving?"
"I?
What
a
question!
I
am
going
because...
well,
because
everyone
is
going:
and
besides--I
am
not
Joan
of
Arc
or
an
Amazon."
"Well,
of
course,
of
course!
Let
me
have
some
more
strips
of
linen."
"If
he
manages
the
business
properly
he
will
be
able
to
pay
off
all
his
debts,"
said
the
militia
officer,
speaking
of
Rostov.
"A
kindly
old
man
but
not
up
to
much.
And
why
do
they
stay
on
so
long
in
Moscow?
They
meant
to
leave
for
the
country
long
ago.
Natalie
is
quite
well
again
now,
isn't
she?"
Julie
asked
Pierre
with
a
knowing
smile.
"They
are
waiting
for
their
younger
son,"
Pierre
replied.
"He
joined
Obolenski's
Cossacks
and
went
to
Belaya
Tserkov
where
the
regiment
is
being
formed.
But
now
they
have
had
him
transferred
to
my
regiment
and
are
expecting
him
every
day.
The
count
wanted
to
leave
long
ago,
but
the
countess
won't
on
any
account
leave
Moscow
till
her
son
returns."
"I
met
them
the
day
before
yesterday
at
the
Arkharovs'.
Natalie
has
recovered
her
looks
and
is
brighter.
She
sang
a
song.
How
easily
some
people
get
over
everything!"
"Get
over
what?"
inquired
Pierre,
looking
displeased.
Julie
smiled.
"You
know,
Count,
such
knights
as
you
are
only
found
in
Madame
de
Souza's
novels."
"What
knights?
What
do
you
mean?"
demanded
Pierre,
blushing.
"Oh,
come,
my
dear
count!
C'est
la
fable
de
tout
Moscou.
Je
vous
admire,
ma
parole
d'honneur!"
*
*
"It
is
the
talk
of
all
Moscow.
My
word,
I
admire
you!"
"Forfeit,
forfeit!"
cried
the
militia
officer.
"All
right,
one
can't
talk--how
tiresome!"
"What
is
'the
talk
of
all
Moscow'?"
Pierre
asked
angrily,
rising
to
his
feet.
"Come
now,
Count,
you
know!"
"I
don't
know
anything
about
it,"
said
Pierre.
"I
know
you
were
friendly
with
Natalie,
and
so...
but
I
was
always
more
friendly
with
Vera--that
dear
Vera."
"No,
madame!"
Pierre
continued
in
a
tone
of
displeasure,
"I
have
not
taken
on
myself
the
role
of
Natalie
Rostova's
knight
at
all,
and
have
not
been
to
their
house
for
nearly
a
month.
But
I
cannot
understand
the
cruelty..."
"Qui
s'excuse
s'accuse,"
*
said
Julie,
smiling
and
waving
the
lint
triumphantly,
and
to
have
the
last
word
she
promptly
changed
the
subject.
"Do
you
know
what
I
heard
today?
Poor
Mary
Bolkonskaya
arrived
in
Moscow
yesterday.
Do
you
know
that
she
has
lost
her
father?"
*
"Who
excuses
himself,
accuses
himself."
"Really?
Where
is
she?
I
should
like
very
much
to
see
her,"
said
Pierre.
"I
spent
the
evening
with
her
yesterday.
She
is
going
to
their
estate
near
Moscow
either
today
or
tomorrow
morning,
with
her
nephew."
"Well,
and
how
is
she?"
asked
Pierre.
"She
is
well,
but
sad.
But
do
you
know
who
rescued
her?
It
is
quite
a
romance.
Nicholas
Rostov!
She
was
surrounded,
and
they
wanted
to
kill
her
and
had
wounded
some
of
her
people.
He
rushed
in
and
saved
her...."
"Another
romance,"
said
the
militia
officer.
"Really,
this
general
flight
has
been
arranged
to
get
all
the
old
maids
married
off.
Catiche
is
one
and
Princess
Bolkonskaya
another."
"Do
you
know,
I
really
believe
she
is
un
petit
peu
amoureuse
du
jeune
homme."
*
*
"A
little
bit
in
love
with
the
young
man."
"Forfeit,
forfeit,
forfeit!"
"But
how
could
one
say
that
in
Russian?"
CHAPTER
XVIII
When
Pierre
returned
home
he
was
handed
two
of
Rostopchin's
broadsheets
that
had
been
brought
that
day.
The
first
declared
that
the
report
that
Count
Rostopchin
had
forbidden
people
to
leave
Moscow
was
false;
on
the
contrary
he
was
glad
that
ladies
and
tradesmen's
wives
were
leaving
the
city.
"There
will
be
less
panic
and
less
gossip,"
ran
the
broadsheet
"but
I
will
stake
my
life
on
it
that
scoundrel
will
not
enter
Moscow."
These
words
showed
Pierre
clearly
for
the
first
time
that
the
French
would
enter
Moscow.
The
second
broadsheet
stated
that
our
headquarters
were
at
Vyazma,
that
Count
Wittgenstein
had
defeated
the
French,
but
that
as
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
Moscow
wished
to
be
armed,
weapons
were
ready
for
them
at
the
arsenal:
sabers,
pistols,
and
muskets
which
could
be
had
at
a
low
price.
The
tone
of
the
proclamation
was
not
as
jocose
as
in
the
former
Chigirin
talks.
Pierre
pondered
over
these
broadsheets.
Evidently
the
terrible
stormcloud
he
had
desired
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
soul
but
which
yet
aroused
involuntary
horror
in
him
was
drawing
near.
"Shall
I
join
the
army
and
enter
the
service,
or
wait?"
he
asked
himself
for
the
hundredth
time.
He
took
a
pack
of
cards
that
lay
on
the
table
and
began
to
lay
them
out
for
a
game
of
patience.
"If
this
patience
comes
out,"
he
said
to
himself
after
shuffling
the
cards,
holding
them
in
his
hand,
and
lifting
his
head,
"if
it
comes
out,
it
means...
what
does
it
mean?"
He
had
not
decided
what
it
should
mean
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
eldest
princess
at
the
door
asking
whether
she
might
come
in.
"Then
it
will
mean
that
I
must
go
to
the
army,"
said
Pierre
to
himself.
"Come
in,
come
in!"
he
added
to
the
princess.
Only
the
eldest
princess,
the
one
with
the
stony
face
and
long
waist,
was
still
living
in
Pierre's
house.
The
two
younger
ones
had
both
married.
"Excuse
my
coming
to
you,
cousin,"
she
said
in
a
reproachful
and
agitated
voice.
"You
know
some
decision
must
be
come
to.
What
is
going
to
happen?
Everyone
has
left
Moscow
and
the
people
are
rioting.
How
is
it
that
we
are
staying
on?"
"On
the
contrary,
things
seem
satisfactory,
ma
cousine,"
said
Pierre
in
the
bantering
tone
he
habitually
adopted
toward
her,
always
feeling
uncomfortable
in
the
role
of
her
benefactor.
"Satisfactory,
indeed!
Very
satisfactory!
Barbara
Ivanovna
told
me
today
how
our
troops
are
distinguishing
themselves.
It
certainly
does
them
credit!
And
the
people
too
are
quite
mutinous--they
no
longer
obey,
even
my
maid
has
taken
to
being
rude.
At
this
rate
they
will
soon
begin
beating
us.
One
can't
walk
in
the
streets.
But,
above
all,
the
French
will
be
here
any
day
now,
so
what
are
we
waiting
for?
I
ask
just
one
thing
of
you,
cousin,"
she
went
on,
"arrange
for
me
to
be
taken
to
Petersburg.
Whatever
I
may
be,
I
can't
live
under
Bonaparte's
rule."
"Oh,
come,
ma
cousine!
Where
do
you
get
your
information
from?
On
the
contrary..."
"I
won't
submit
to
your
Napoleon!
Others
may
if
they
please....
If
you
don't
want
to
do
this..."
"But
I
will,
I'll
give
the
order
at
once."
The
princess
was
apparently
vexed
at
not
having
anyone
to
be
angry
with.
Muttering
to
herself,
she
sat
down
on
a
chair.
"But
you
have
been
misinformed,"
said
Pierre.
"Everything
is
quiet
in
the
city
and
there
is
not
the
slightest
danger.
See!
I've
just
been
reading..."
He
showed
her
the
broadsheet.
"Count
Rostopchin
writes
that
he
will
stake
his
life
on
it
that
the
enemy
will
not
enter
Moscow."
"Oh,
that
count
of
yours!"
said
the
princess
malevolently.
"He
is
a
hypocrite,
a
rascal
who
has
himself
roused
the
people
to
riot.
Didn't
he
write
in
those
idiotic
broadsheets
that
anyone,
'whoever
it
might
be,
should
be
dragged
to
the
lockup
by
his
hair'?
(How
silly!)
'And
honor
and
glory
to
whoever
captures
him,'
he
says.
This
is
what
his
cajolery
has
brought
us
to!
Barbara
Ivanovna
told
me
the
mob
near
killed
her
because
she
said
something
in
French."
"Oh,
but
it's
so...
You
take
everything
so
to
heart,"
said
Pierre,
and
began
laying
out
his
cards
for
patience.
Although
that
patience
did
come
out,
Pierre
did
not
join
the
army,
but
remained
in
deserted
Moscow
ever
in
the
same
state
of
agitation,
irresolution,
and
alarm,
yet
at
the
same
time
joyfully
expecting
something
terrible.
Next
day
toward
evening
the
princess
set
off,
and
Pierre's
head
steward
came
to
inform
him
that
the
money
needed
for
the
equipment
of
his
regiment
could
not
be
found
without
selling
one
of
the
estates.
In
general
the
head
steward
made
out
to
Pierre
that
his
project
of
raising
a
regiment
would
ruin
him.
Pierre
listened
to
him,
scarcely
able
to
repress
a
smile.
"Well
then,
sell
it,"
said
he.
"What's
to
be
done?
I
can't
draw
back
now!"
The
worse
everything
became,
especially
his
own
affairs,
the
better
was
Pierre
pleased
and
the
more
evident
was
it
that
the
catastrophe
he
expected
was
approaching.
Hardly
anyone
he
knew
was
left
in
town.
Julie
had
gone,
and
so
had
Princess
Mary.
Of
his
intimate
friends
only
the
Rostovs
remained,
but
he
did
not
go
to
see
them.
To
distract
his
thoughts
he
drove
that
day
to
the
village
of
Vorontsovo
to
see
the
great
balloon
Leppich
was
constructing
to
destroy
the
foe,
and
a
trial
balloon
that
was
to
go
up
next
day.
The
balloon
was
not
yet
ready,
but
Pierre
learned
that
it
was
being
constructed
by
the
Emperor's
desire.
The
Emperor
had
written
to
Count
Rostopchin
as
follows:
As
soon
as
Leppich
is
ready,
get
together
a
crew
of
reliable
and
intelligent
men
for
his
car
and
send
a
courier
to
General
Kutuzov
to
let
him
know.
I
have
informed
him
of
the
matter.
Please
impress
upon
Leppich
to
be
very
careful
where
he
descends
for
the
first
time,
that
he
may
not
make
a
mistake
and
fall
into
the
enemy's
hands.
It
is
essential
for
him
to
combine
his
movements
with
those
of
the
commander-in-chief.
On
his
way
home
from
Vorontsovo,
as
he
was
passing
the
Bolotnoe
Place
Pierre,
seeing
a
large
crowd
round
the
Lobnoe
Place,
stopped
and
got
out
of
his
trap.
A
French
cook
accused
of
being
a
spy
was
being
flogged.
The
flogging
was
only
just
over,
and
the
executioner
was
releasing
from
the
flogging
bench
a
stout
man
with
red
whiskers,
in
blue
stockings
and
a
green
jacket,
who
was
moaning
piteously.
Another
criminal,
thin
and
pale,
stood
near.
Judging
by
their
faces
they
were
both
Frenchmen.
With
a
frightened
and
suffering
look
resembling
that
on
the
thin
Frenchman's
face,
Pierre
pushed
his
way
in
through
the
crowd.
"What
is
it?
Who
is
it?
What
is
it
for?"
he
kept
asking.
But
the
attention
of
the
crowd--officials,
burghers,
shopkeepers,
peasants,
and
women
in
cloaks
and
in
pelisses--was
so
eagerly
centered
on
what
was
passing
in
Lobnoe
Place
that
no
one
answered
him.
The
stout
man
rose,
frowned,
shrugged
his
shoulders,
and
evidently
trying
to
appear
firm
began
to
pull
on
his
jacket
without
looking
about
him,
but
suddenly
his
lips
trembled
and
he
began
to
cry,
in
the
way
full-blooded
grown-up
men
cry,
though
angry
with
himself
for
doing
so.
In
the
crowd
people
began
talking
loudly,
to
stifle
their
feelings
of
pity
as
it
seemed
to
Pierre.
"He's
cook
to
some
prince."
"Eh,
mounseer,
Russian
sauce
seems
to
be
sour
to
a
Frenchman...
sets
his
teeth
on
edge!"
said
a
wrinkled
clerk
who
was
standing
behind
Pierre,
when
the
Frenchman
began
to
cry.
The
clerk
glanced
round,
evidently
hoping
that
his
joke
would
be
appreciated.
Some
people
began
to
laugh,
others
continued
to
watch
in
dismay
the
executioner
who
was
undressing
the
other
man.
Pierre
choked,
his
face
puckered,
and
he
turned
hastily
away,
went
back
to
his
trap
muttering
something
to
himself
as
he
went,
and
took
his
seat.
As
they
drove
along
he
shuddered
and
exclaimed
several
times
so
audibly
that
the
coachman
asked
him:
"What
is
your
pleasure?"
"Where
are
you
going?"
shouted
Pierre
to
the
man,
who
was
driving
to
Lubyanka
Street.
"To
the
Governor's,
as
you
ordered,"
answered
the
coachman.
"Fool!
Idiot!"
shouted
Pierre,
abusing
his
coachman--a
thing
he
rarely
did.
"Home,
I
told
you!
And
drive
faster,
blockhead!"
"I
must
get
away
this
very
day,"
he
murmured
to
himself.
At
the
sight
of
the
tortured
Frenchman
and
the
crowd
surrounding
the
Lobnoe
Place,
Pierre
had
so
definitely
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
no
longer
remain
in
Moscow
and
would
leave
for
the
army
that
very
day
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
either
he
had
told
the
coachman
this
or
that
the
man
ought
to
have
known
it
for
himself.
On
reaching
home
Pierre
gave
orders
to
Evstafey--his
head
coachman
who
knew
everything,
could
do
anything,
and
was
known
to
all
Moscow--that
he
would
leave
that
night
for
the
army
at
Mozhaysk,
and
that
his
saddle
horses
should
be
sent
there.
This
could
not
all
be
arranged
that
day,
so
on
Evstafey's
representation
Pierre
had
to
put
off
his
departure
till
next
day
to
allow
time
for
the
relay
horses
to
be
sent
on
in
advance.
On
the
twenty-fourth
the
weather
cleared
up
after
a
spell
of
rain,
and
after
dinner
Pierre
left
Moscow.
When
changing
horses
that
night
in
Perkhushkovo,
he
learned
that
there
had
been
a
great
battle
that
evening.
(This
was
the
battle
of
Shevardino.)
He
was
told
that
there
in
Perkhushkovo
the
earth
trembled
from
the
firing,
but
nobody
could
answer
his
questions
as
to
who
had
won.
At
dawn
next
day
Pierre
was
approaching
Mozhaysk.
Every
house
in
Mozhaysk
had
soldiers
quartered
in
it,
and
at
the
hostel
where
Pierre
was
met
by
his
groom
and
coachman
there
was
no
room
to
be
had.
It
was
full
of
officers.
Everywhere
in
Mozhaysk
and
beyond
it,
troops
were
stationed
or
on
the
march.
Cossacks,
foot
and
horse
soldiers,
wagons,
caissons,
and
cannon
were
everywhere.
Pierre
pushed
forward
as
fast
as
he
could,
and
the
farther
he
left
Moscow
behind
and
the
deeper
he
plunged
into
that
sea
of
troops
the
more
was
he
overcome
by
restless
agitation
and
a
new
and
joyful
feeling
he
had
not
experienced
before.
It
was
a
feeling
akin
to
what
he
had
felt
at
the
Sloboda
Palace
during
the
Emperor's
visit--a
sense
of
the
necessity
of
undertaking
something
and
sacrificing
something.
He
now
experienced
a
glad
consciousness
that
everything
that
constitutes
men's
happiness--the
comforts
of
life,
wealth,
even
life
itself--is
rubbish
it
is
pleasant
to
throw
away,
compared
with
something...
With
what?
Pierre
could
not
say,
and
he
did
not
try
to
determine
for
whom
and
for
what
he
felt
such
particular
delight
in
sacrificing
everything.
He
was
not
occupied
with
the
question
of
what
to
sacrifice
for;
the
fact
of
sacrificing
in
itself
afforded
him
a
new
and
joyous
sensation.
CHAPTER
XIX
On
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
the
battle
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
fought,
on
the
twenty-fifth
not
a
shot
was
fired
by
either
side,
and
on
the
twenty-sixth
the
battle
of
Borodino
itself
took
place.
Why
and
how
were
the
battles
of
Shevardino
and
Borodino
given
and
accepted?
Why
was
the
battle
of
Borodino
fought?
There
was
not
the
least
sense
in
it
for
either
the
French
or
the
Russians.
Its
immediate
result
for
the
Russians
was,
and
was
bound
to
be,
that
we
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
Moscow--which
we
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world;
and
for
the
French
its
immediate
result
was
that
they
were
brought
nearer
to
the
destruction
of
their
whole
army--which
they
feared
more
than
anything
in
the
world.
What
the
result
must
be
was
quite
obvious,
and
yet
Napoleon
offered
and
Kutuzov
accepted
that
battle.
If
the
commanders
had
been
guided
by
reason,
it
would
seem
that
it
must
have
been
obvious
to
Napoleon
that
by
advancing
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
giving
battle
with
a
probability
of
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army,
he
was
advancing
to
certain
destruction,
and
it
must
have
been
equally
clear
to
Kutuzov
that
by
accepting
battle
and
risking
the
loss
of
a
quarter
of
his
army
he
would
certainly
lose
Moscow.
For
Kutuzov
this
was
mathematically
clear,
as
it
is
that
if
when
playing
draughts
I
have
one
man
less
and
go
on
exchanging,
I
shall
certainly
lose,
and
therefore
should
not
exchange.
When
my
opponent
has
sixteen
men
and
I
have
fourteen,
I
am
only
one
eighth
weaker
than
he,
but
when
I
have
exchanged
thirteen
more
men
he
will
be
three
times
as
strong
as
I
am.
Before
the
battle
of
Borodino
our
strength
in
proportion
to
the
French
was
about
as
five
to
six,
but
after
that
battle
it
was
little
more
than
one
to
two:
previously
we
had
a
hundred
thousand
against
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand;
afterwards
little
more
than
fifty
thousand
against
a
hundred
thousand.
Yet
the
shrewd
and
experienced
Kutuzov
accepted
the
battle,
while
Napoleon,
who
was
said
to
be
a
commander
of
genius,
gave
it,
losing
a
quarter
of
his
army
and
lengthening
his
lines
of
communication
still
more.
If
it
is
said
that
he
expected
to
end
the
campaign
by
occupying
Moscow
as
he
had
ended
a
previous
campaign
by
occupying
Vienna,
there
is
much
evidence
to
the
contrary.
Napoleon's
historians
themselves
tell
us
that
from
Smolensk
onwards
he
wished
to
stop,
knew
the
danger
of
his
extended
position,
and
knew
that
the
occupation
of
Moscow
would
not
be
the
end
of
the
campaign,
for
he
had
seen
at
Smolensk
the
state
in
which
Russian
towns
were
left
to
him,
and
had
not
received
a
single
reply
to
his
repeated
announcements
of
his
wish
to
negotiate.
In
giving
and
accepting
battle
at
Borodino,
Kutuzov
acted
involuntarily
and
irrationally.
But
later
on,
to
fit
what
had
occurred,
the
historians
provided
cunningly
devised
evidence
of
the
foresight
and
genius
of
the
generals
who,
of
all
the
blind
tools
of
history
were
the
most
enslaved
and
involuntary.
The
ancients
have
left
us
model
heroic
poems
in
which
the
heroes
furnish
the
whole
interest
of
the
story,
and
we
are
still
unable
to
accustom
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
for
our
epoch
histories
of
that
kind
are
meaningless.
On
the
other
question,
how
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
the
preceding
battle
of
Shevardino
were
fought,
there
also
exists
a
definite
and
well-
known,
but
quite
false,
conception.
All
the
historians
describe
the
affair
as
follows:
The
Russian
army,
they
say,
in
its
retreat
from
Smolensk
sought
out
for
itself
the
best
position
for
a
general
engagement
and
found
such
a
position
at
Borodino.
The
Russians,
they
say,
fortified
this
position
in
advance
on
the
left
of
the
highroad
(from
Moscow
to
Smolensk)
and
almost
at
a
right
angle
to
it,
from
Borodino
to
Utitsa,
at
the
very
place
where
the
battle
was
fought.
In
front
of
this
position,
they
say,
a
fortified
outpost
was
set
up
on
the
Shevardino
mound
to
observe
the
enemy.
On
the
twenty-fourth,
we
are
told,
Napoleon
attacked
this
advanced
post
and
took
it,
and,
on
the
twenty-sixth,
attacked
the
whole
Russian
army,
which
was
in
position
on
the
field
of
Borodino.
So
the
histories
say,
and
it
is
all
quite
wrong,
as
anyone
who
cares
to
look
into
the
matter
can
easily
convince
himself.
The
Russians
did
not
seek
out
the
best
position
but,
on
the
contrary,
during
the
retreat
passed
many
positions
better
than
Borodino.
They
did
not
stop
at
any
one
of
these
positions
because
Kutuzov
did
not
wish
to
occupy
a
position
he
had
not
himself
chosen,
because
the
popular
demand
for
a
battle
had
not
yet
expressed
itself
strongly
enough,
and
because
Miloradovich
had
not
yet
arrived
with
the
militia,
and
for
many
other
reasons.
The
fact
is
that
other
positions
they
had
passed
were
stronger,
and
that
the
position
at
Borodino
(the
one
where
the
battle
was
fought),
far
from
being
strong,
was
no
more
a
position
than
any
other
spot
one
might
find
in
the
Russian
Empire
by
sticking
a
pin
into
the
map
at
hazard.
Not
only
did
the
Russians
not
fortify
the
position
on
the
field
of
Borodino
to
the
left
of,
and
at
a
right
angle
to,
the
highroad
(that
is,
the
position
on
which
the
battle
took
place),
but
never
till
the
twenty-
fifth
of
August,
1812,
did
they
think
that
a
battle
might
be
fought
there.
This
was
shown
first
by
the
fact
that
there
were
no
entrenchments
there
by
the
twenty
fifth
and
that
those
begun
on
the
twenty-fifth
and
twenty-sixth
were
not
completed,
and
secondly,
by
the
position
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt.
That
redoubt
was
quite
senseless
in
front
of
the
position
where
the
battle
was
accepted.
Why
was
it
more
strongly
fortified
than
any
other
post?
And
why
were
all
efforts
exhausted
and
six
thousand
men
sacrificed
to
defend
it
till
late
at
night
on
the
twenty-fourth?
A
Cossack
patrol
would
have
sufficed
to
observe
the
enemy.
Thirdly,
as
proof
that
the
position
on
which
the
battle
was
fought
had
not
been
foreseen
and
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
not
an
advanced
post
of
that
position,
we
have
the
fact
that
up
to
the
twenty-
fifth,
Barclay
de
Tolly
and
Bagration
were
convinced
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
the
position,
and
that
Kutuzov
himself
in
his
report,
written
in
hot
haste
after
the
battle,
speaks
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
as
the
left
flank
of
the
position.
It
was
much
later,
when
reports
on
the
battle
of
Borodino
were
written
at
leisure,
that
the
incorrect
and
extraordinary
statement
was
invented
(probably
to
justify
the
mistakes
of
a
commander-in-chief
who
had
to
be
represented
as
infallible)
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
an
advanced
post--whereas
in
reality
it
was
simply
a
fortified
point
on
the
left
flank--and
that
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
fought
by
us
on
an
entrenched
position
previously
selected,
where
as
it
was
fought
on
a
quite
unexpected
spot
which
was
almost
unentrenched.
The
case
was
evidently
this:
a
position
was
selected
along
the
river
Kolocha--which
crosses
the
highroad
not
at
a
right
angle
but
at
an
acute
angle--so
that
the
left
flank
was
at
Shevardino,
the
right
flank
near
the
village
of
Novoe,
and
the
center
at
Borodino
at
the
confluence
of
the
rivers
Kolocha
and
Voyna.
To
anyone
who
looks
at
the
field
of
Borodino
without
thinking
of
how
the
battle
was
actually
fought,
this
position,
protected
by
the
river
Kolocha,
presents
itself
as
obvious
for
an
army
whose
object
was
to
prevent
an
enemy
from
advancing
along
the
Smolensk
road
to
Moscow.
Napoleon,
riding
to
Valuevo
on
the
twenty-fourth,
did
not
see
(as
the
history
books
say
he
did)
the
position
of
the
Russians
from
Utitsa
to
Borodino
(he
could
not
have
seen
that
position
because
it
did
not
exist),
nor
did
he
see
an
advanced
post
of
the
Russian
army,
but
while
pursuing
the
Russian
rearguard
he
came
upon
the
left
flank
of
the
Russian
position--at
the
Shevardino
Redoubt--and
unexpectedly
for
the
Russians
moved
his
army
across
the
Kolocha.
And
the
Russians,
not
having
time
to
begin
a
general
engagement,
withdrew
their
left
wing
from
the
position
they
had
intended
to
occupy
and
took
up
a
new
position
which
had
not
been
foreseen
and
was
not
fortified.
By
crossing
to
the
other
side
of
the
Kolocha
to
the
left
of
the
highroad,
Napoleon
shifted
the
whole
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left
(looking
from
the
Russian
side)
and
transferred
it
to
the
plain
between
Utitsa,
Semenovsk,
and
Borodino--a
plain
no
more
advantageous
as
a
position
than
any
other
plain
in
Russia--and
there
the
whole
battle
of
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
took
place.
Had
Napoleon
not
ridden
out
on
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fourth
to
the
Kolocha,
and
had
he
not
then
ordered
an
immediate
attack
on
the
redoubt
but
had
begun
the
attack
next
morning,
no
one
would
have
doubted
that
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
was
the
left
flank
of
our
position,
and
the
battle
would
have
taken
place
where
we
expected
it.
In
that
case
we
should
probably
have
defended
the
Shevardino
Redoubt--our
left
flank--
still
more
obstinately.
We
should
have
attacked
Napoleon
in
the
center
or
on
the
right,
and
the
engagement
would
have
taken
place
on
the
twenty-fifth,
in
the
position
we
intended
and
had
fortified.
But
as
the
attack
on
our
left
flank
took
place
in
the
evening
after
the
retreat
of
our
rear
guard
(that
is,
immediately
after
the
fight
at
Gridneva),
and
as
the
Russian
commanders
did
not
wish,
or
were
not
in
time,
to
begin
a
general
engagement
then
on
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fourth,
the
first
and
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
already
lost
on
the
twenty-fourth,
and
obviously
led
to
the
loss
of
the
one
fought
on
the
twenty-sixth.
After
the
loss
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt,
we
found
ourselves
on
the
morning
of
the
twenty-fifth
without
a
position
for
our
left
flank,
and
were
forced
to
bend
it
back
and
hastily
entrench
it
where
it
chanced
to
be.
Not
only
was
the
Russian
army
on
the
twenty-sixth
defended
by
weak,
unfinished
entrenchments,
but
the
disadvantage
of
that
position
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
Russian
commanders--not
having
fully
realized
what
had
happened,
namely
the
loss
of
our
position
on
the
left
flank
and
the
shifting
of
the
whole
field
of
the
forthcoming
battle
from
right
to
left--maintained
their
extended
position
from
the
village
of
Novoe
to
Utitsa,
and
consequently
had
to
move
their
forces
from
right
to
left
during
the
battle.
So
it
happened
that
throughout
the
whole
battle
the
Russians
opposed
the
entire
French
army
launched
against
our
left
flank
with
but
half
as
many
men.
(Poniatowski's
action
against
Utitsa,
and
Uvarov's
on
the
right
flank
against
the
French,
were
actions
distinct
from
the
main
course
of
the
battle.)
So
the
battle
of
Borodino
did
not
take
place
at
all
as
(in
an
effort
to
conceal
our
commanders'
mistakes
even
at
the
cost
of
diminishing
the
glory
due
to
the
Russian
army
and
people)
it
has
been
described.
The
battle
of
Borodino
was
not
fought
on
a
chosen
and
entrenched
position
with
forces
only
slightly
weaker
than
those
of
the
enemy,
but,
as
a
result
of
the
loss
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt,
the
Russians
fought
the
battle
of
Borodino
on
an
open
and
almost
unentrenched
position,
with
forces
only
half
as
numerous
as
the
French;
that
is
to
say,
under
conditions
in
which
it
was
not
merely
unthinkable
to
fight
for
ten
hours
and
secure
an
indecisive
result,
but
unthinkable
to
keep
an
army
even
from
complete
disintegration
and
flight.
CHAPTER
XX
On
the
morning
of
the
twenty-fifth
Pierre
was
leaving
Mozhaysk.
At
the
descent
of
the
high
steep
hill,
down
which
a
winding
road
led
out
of
the
town
past
the
cathedral
on
the
right,
where
a
service
was
being
held
and
the
bells
were
ringing,
Pierre
got
out
of
his
vehicle
and
proceeded
on
foot.
Behind
him
a
cavalry
regiment
was
coming
down
the
hill
preceded
by
its
singers.
Coming
up
toward
him
was
a
train
of
carts
carrying
men
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
engagement
the
day
before.
The
peasant
drivers,
shouting
and
lashing
their
horses,
kept
crossing
from
side
to
side.
The
carts,
in
each
of
which
three
or
four
wounded
soldiers
were
lying
or
sitting,
jolted
over
the
stones
that
had
been
thrown
on
the
steep
incline
to
make
it
something
like
a
road.
The
wounded,
bandaged
with
rags,
with
pale
cheeks,
compressed
lips,
and
knitted
brows,
held
on
to
the
sides
of
the
carts
as
they
were
jolted
against
one
another.
Almost
all
of
them
stared
with
naive,
childlike
curiosity
at
Pierre's
white
hat
and
green
swallow-tail
coat.
Pierre's
coachman
shouted
angrily
at
the
convoy
of
wounded
to
keep
to
one
side
of
the
road.
The
cavalry
regiment,
as
it
descended
the
hill
with
its
singers,
surrounded
Pierre's
carriage
and
blocked
the
road.
Pierre
stopped,
being
pressed
against
the
side
of
the
cutting
in
which
the
road
ran.
The
sunshine
from
behind
the
hill
did
not
penetrate
into
the
cutting
and
there
it
was
cold
and
damp,
but
above
Pierre's
head
was
the
bright
August
sunshine
and
the
bells
sounded
merrily.
One
of
the
carts
with
wounded
stopped
by
the
side
of
the
road
close
to
Pierre.
The
driver
in
his
bast
shoes
ran
panting
up
to
it,
placed
a
stone
under
one
of
its
tireless
hind
wheels,
and
began
arranging
the
breech-band
on
his
little
horse.
One
of
the
wounded,
an
old
soldier
with
a
bandaged
arm
who
was
following
the
cart
on
foot,
caught
hold
of
it
with
his
sound
hand
and
turned
to
look
at
Pierre.
"I
say,
fellow
countryman!
Will
they
set
us
down
here
or
take
us
on
to
Moscow?"
he
asked.
Pierre
was
so
deep
in
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
the
question.
He
was
looking
now
at
the
cavalry
regiment
that
had
met
the
convoy
of
wounded,
now
at
the
cart
by
which
he
was
standing,
in
which
two
wounded
men
were
sitting
and
one
was
lying.
One
of
those
sitting
up
in
the
cart
had
probably
been
wounded
in
the
cheek.
His
whole
head
was
wrapped
in
rags
and
one
cheek
was
swollen
to
the
size
of
a
baby's
head.
His
nose
and
mouth
were
twisted
to
one
side.
This
soldier
was
looking
at
the
cathedral
and
crossing
himself.
Another,
a
young
lad,
a
fair-haired
recruit
as
white
as
though
there
was
no
blood
in
his
thin
face,
looked
at
Pierre
kindly,
with
a
fixed
smile.
The
third
lay
prone
so
that
his
face
was
not
visible.
The
cavalry
singers
were
passing
close
by:
Ah
lost,
quite
lost...
is
my
head
so
keen,
Living
in
a
foreign
land.
they
sang
their
soldiers'
dance
song.
As
if
responding
to
them
but
with
a
different
sort
of
merriment,
the
metallic
sound
of
the
bells
reverberated
high
above
and
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
bathed
the
top
of
the
opposite
slope
with
yet
another
sort
of
merriment.
But
beneath
the
slope,
by
the
cart
with
the
wounded
near
the
panting
little
nag
where
Pierre
stood,
it
was
damp,
somber,
and
sad.
The
soldier
with
the
swollen
cheek
looked
angrily
at
the
cavalry
singers.
"Oh,
the
coxcombs!"
he
muttered
reproachfully.
"It's
not
the
soldiers
only,
but
I've
seen
peasants
today,
too....
The
peasants--even
they
have
to
go,"
said
the
soldier
behind
the
cart,
addressing
Pierre
with
a
sad
smile.
"No
distinctions
made
nowadays....
They
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them--in
a
word,
it's
Moscow!
They
want
to
make
an
end
of
it."
In
spite
of
the
obscurity
of
the
soldier's
words
Pierre
understood
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
nodded
approval.
The
road
was
clear
again;
Pierre
descended
the
hill
and
drove
on.
He
kept
looking
to
either
side
of
the
road
for
familiar
faces,
but
only
saw
everywhere
the
unfamiliar
faces
of
various
military
men
of
different
branches
of
the
service,
who
all
looked
with
astonishment
at
his
white
hat
and
green
tail
coat.
Having
gone
nearly
three
miles
he
at
last
met
an
acquaintance
and
eagerly
addressed
him.
This
was
one
of
the
head
army
doctors.
He
was
driving
toward
Pierre
in
a
covered
gig,
sitting
beside
a
young
surgeon,
and
on
recognizing
Pierre
he
told
the
Cossack
who
occupied
the
driver's
seat
to
pull
up.
"Count!
Your
excellency,
how
come
you
to
be
here?"
asked
the
doctor.
"Well,
you
know,
I
wanted
to
see..."
"Yes,
yes,
there
will
be
something
to
see...."
Pierre
got
out
and
talked
to
the
doctor,
explaining
his
intention
of
taking
part
in
a
battle.
The
doctor
advised
him
to
apply
direct
to
Kutuzov.
"Why
should
you
be
God
knows
where
out
of
sight,
during
the
battle?"
he
said,
exchanging
glances
with
his
young
companion.
"Anyhow
his
Serene
Highness
knows
you
and
will
receive
you
graciously.
That's
what
you
must
do."
The
doctor
seemed
tired
and
in
a
hurry.
"You
think
so?...
Ah,
I
also
wanted
to
ask
you
where
our
position
is
exactly?"
said
Pierre.
"The
position?"
repeated
the
doctor.
"Well,
that's
not
my
line.
Drive
past
Tatarinova,
a
lot
of
digging
is
going
on
there.
Go
up
the
hillock
and
you'll
see."
"Can
one
see
from
there?...
If
you
would..."
But
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
moved
toward
his
gig.
"I
would
go
with
you
but
on
my
honor
I'm
up
to
here"--and
he
pointed
to
his
throat.
"I'm
galloping
to
the
commander
of
the
corps.
How
do
matters
stand?...
You
know,
Count,
there'll
be
a
battle
tomorrow.
Out
of
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
we
must
expect
at
least
twenty
thousand
wounded,
and
we
haven't
stretchers,
or
bunks,
or
dressers,
or
doctors
enough
for
six
thousand.
We
have
ten
thousand
carts,
but
we
need
other
things
as
well--we
must
manage
as
best
we
can!"
The
strange
thought
that
of
the
thousands
of
men,
young
and
old,
who
had
stared
with
merry
surprise
at
his
hat
(perhaps
the
very
men
he
had
noticed),
twenty
thousand
were
inevitably
doomed
to
wounds
and
death
amazed
Pierre.
"They
may
die
tomorrow;
why
are
they
thinking
of
anything
but
death?"
And
by
some
latent
sequence
of
thought
the
descent
of
the
Mozhaysk
hill,
the
carts
with
the
wounded,
the
ringing
bells,
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun,
and
the
songs
of
the
cavalrymen
vividly
recurred
to
his
mind.
"The
cavalry
ride
to
battle
and
meet
the
wounded
and
do
not
for
a
moment
think
of
what
awaits
them,
but
pass
by,
winking
at
the
wounded.
Yet
from
among
these
men
twenty
thousand
are
doomed
to
die,
and
they
wonder
at
my
hat!
Strange!"
thought
Pierre,
continuing
his
way
to
Tatarinova.
In
front
of
a
landowner's
house
to
the
left
of
the
road
stood
carriages,
wagons,
and
crowds
of
orderlies
and
sentinels.
The
commander-in-chief
was
putting
up
there,
but
just
when
Pierre
arrived
he
was
not
in
and
hardly
any
of
the
staff
were
there--they
had
gone
to
the
church
service.
Pierre
drove
on
toward
Gorki.
When
he
had
ascended
the
hill
and
reached
the
little
village
street,
he
saw
for
the
first
time
peasant
militiamen
in
their
white
shirts
and
with
crosses
on
their
caps,
who,
talking
and
laughing
loudly,
animated
and
perspiring,
were
at
work
on
a
huge
knoll
overgrown
with
grass
to
the
right
of
the
road.
Some
of
them
were
digging,
others
were
wheeling
barrowloads
of
earth
along
planks,
while
others
stood
about
doing
nothing.
Two
officers
were
standing
on
the
knoll,
directing
the
men.
On
seeing
these
peasants,
who
were
evidently
still
amused
by
the
novelty
of
their
position
as
soldiers,
Pierre
once
more
thought
of
the
wounded
men
at
Mozhaysk
and
understood
what
the
soldier
had
meant
when
he
said:
"They
want
the
whole
nation
to
fall
on
them."
The
sight
of
these
bearded
peasants
at
work
on
the
battlefield,
with
their
queer,
clumsy
boots
and
perspiring
necks,
and
their
shirts
opening
from
the
left
toward
the
middle,
unfastened,
exposing
their
sunburned
collarbones,
impressed
Pierre
more
strongly
with
the
solemnity
and
importance
of
the
moment
than
anything
he
had
yet
seen
or
heard.
CHAPTER
XXI
Pierre
stepped
out
of
his
carriage
and,
passing
the
toiling
militiamen,
ascended
the
knoll
from
which,
according
to
the
doctor,
the
battlefield
could
be
seen.
It
was
about
eleven
o'clock.
The
sun
shone
somewhat
to
the
left
and
behind
him
and
brightly
lit
up
the
enormous
panorama
which,
rising
like
an
amphitheater,
extended
before
him
in
the
clear
rarefied
atmosphere.
From
above
on
the
left,
bisecting
that
amphitheater,
wound
the
Smolensk
highroad,
passing
through
a
village
with
a
white
church
some
five
hundred
paces
in
front
of
the
knoll
and
below
it.
This
was
Borodino.
Below
the
village
the
road
crossed
the
river
by
a
bridge
and,
winding
down
and
up,
rose
higher
and
higher
to
the
village
of
Valuevo
visible
about
four
miles
away,
where
Napoleon
was
then
stationed.
Beyond
Valuevo
the
road
disappeared
into
a
yellowing
forest
on
the
horizon.
Far
in
the
distance
in
that
birch
and
fir
forest
to
the
right
of
the
road,
the
cross
and
belfry
of
the
Kolocha
Monastery
gleamed
in
the
sun.
Here
and
there
over
the
whole
of
that
blue
expanse,
to
right
and
left
of
the
forest
and
the
road,
smoking
campfires
could
be
seen
and
indefinite
masses
of
troops--ours
and
the
enemy's.
The
ground
to
the
right--along
the
course
of
the
Kolocha
and
Moskva
rivers--was
broken
and
hilly.
Between
the
hollows
the
villages
of
Bezubova
and
Zakharino
showed
in
the
distance.
On
the
left
the
ground
was
more
level;
there
were
fields
of
grain,
and
the
smoking
ruins
of
Semenovsk,
which
had
been
burned
down,
could
be
seen.
All
that
Pierre
saw
was
so
indefinite
that
neither
the
left
nor
the
right
side
of
the
field
fully
satisfied
his
expectations.
Nowhere
could
he
see
the
battlefield
he
had
expected
to
find,
but
only
fields,
meadows,
troops,
woods,
the
smoke
of
campfires,
villages,
mounds,
and
streams;
and
try
as
he
would
he
could
descry
no
military
"position"
in
this
place
which
teemed
with
life,
nor
could
he
even
distinguish
our
troops
from
the
enemy's.
"I
must
ask
someone
who
knows,"
he
thought,
and
addressed
an
officer
who
was
looking
with
curiosity
at
his
huge
unmilitary
figure.
"May
I
ask
you,"
said
Pierre,
"what
village
that
is
in
front?"
"Burdino,
isn't
it?"
said
the
officer,
turning
to
his
companion.
"Borodino,"
the
other
corrected
him.
The
officer,
evidently
glad
of
an
opportunity
for
a
talk,
moved
up
to
Pierre.
"Are
those
our
men
there?"
Pierre
inquired.
"Yes,
and
there,
further
on,
are
the
French,"
said
the
officer.
"There
they
are,
there...
you
can
see
them."
"Where?
Where?"
asked
Pierre.
"One
can
see
them
with
the
naked
eye...
Why,
there!"
The
officer
pointed
with
his
hand
to
the
smoke
visible
on
the
left
beyond
the
river,
and
the
same
stern
and
serious
expression
that
Pierre
had
noticed
on
many
of
the
faces
he
had
met
came
into
his
face.
"Ah,
those
are
the
French!
And
over
there?..."
Pierre
pointed
to
a
knoll
on
the
left,
near
which
some
troops
could
be
seen.
"Those
are
ours."
"Ah,
ours!
And
there?..."
Pierre
pointed
to
another
knoll
in
the
distance
with
a
big
tree
on
it,
near
a
village
that
lay
in
a
hollow
where
also
some
campfires
were
smoking
and
something
black
was
visible.
"That's
his
again,"
said
the
officer.
(It
was
the
Shevardino
Redoubt.)
"It
was
ours
yesterday,
but
now
it
is
his."
"Then
how
about
our
position?"
"Our
position?"
replied
the
officer
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction.
"I
can
tell
you
quite
clearly,
because
I
constructed
nearly
all
our
entrenchments.
There,
you
see?
There's
our
center,
at
Borodino,
just
there,"
and
he
pointed
to
the
village
in
front
of
them
with
the
white
church.
"That's
where
one
crosses
the
Kolocha.
You
see
down
there
where
the
rows
of
hay
are
lying
in
the
hollow,
there's
the
bridge.
That's
our
center.
Our
right
flank
is
over
there"--he
pointed
sharply
to
the
right,
far
away
in
the
broken
ground--"That's
where
the
Moskva
River
is,
and
we
have
thrown
up
three
redoubts
there,
very
strong
ones.
The
left
flank..."
here
the
officer
paused.
"Well,
you
see,
that's
difficult
to
explain....
Yesterday
our
left
flank
was
there
at
Shevardino,
you
see,
where
the
oak
is,
but
now
we
have
withdrawn
our
left
wing--now
it
is
over
there,
do
you
see
that
village
and
the
smoke?
That's
Semenovsk,
yes,
there,"
he
pointed
to
Raevski's
knoll.
"But
the
battle
will
hardly
be
there.
His
having
moved
his
troops
there
is
only
a
ruse;
he
will
probably
pass
round
to
the
right
of
the
Moskva.
But
wherever
it
may
be,
many
a
man
will
be
missing
tomorrow!"
he
remarked.
An
elderly
sergeant
who
had
approached
the
officer
while
he
was
giving
these
explanations
had
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
finish
speaking,
but
at
this
point,
evidently
not
liking
the
officer's
remark,
interrupted
him.
"Gabions
must
be
sent
for,"
said
he
sternly.
The
officer
appeared
abashed,
as
though
he
understood
that
one
might
think
of
how
many
men
would
be
missing
tomorrow
but
ought
not
to
speak
of
it.
"Well,
send
number
three
company
again,"
the
officer
replied
hurriedly.
"And
you,
are
you
one
of
the
doctors?"
"No,
I've
come
on
my
own,"
answered
Pierre,
and
he
went
down
the
hill
again,
passing
the
militiamen.
"Oh,
those
damned
fellows!"
muttered
the
officer
who
followed
him,
holding
his
nose
as
he
ran
past
the
men
at
work.
"There
they
are...
bringing
her,
coming...
There
they
are...
They'll
be
here
in
a
minute..."
voices
were
suddenly
heard
saying;
and
officers,
soldiers,
and
militiamen
began
running
forward
along
the
road.
A
church
procession
was
coming
up
the
hill
from
Borodino.
First
along
the
dusty
road
came
the
infantry
in
ranks,
bareheaded
and
with
arms
reversed.
From
behind
them
came
the
sound
of
church
singing.
Soldiers
and
militiamen
ran
bareheaded
past
Pierre
toward
the
procession.
"They
are
bringing
her,
our
Protectress!...
The
Iberian
Mother
of
God!"
someone
cried.
"The
Smolensk
Mother
of
God,"
another
corrected
him.
The
militiamen,
both
those
who
had
been
in
the
village
and
those
who
had
been
at
work
on
the
battery,
threw
down
their
spades
and
ran
to
meet
the
church
procession.
Following
the
battalion
that
marched
along
the
dusty
road
came
priests
in
their
vestments--one
little
old
man
in
a
hood
with
attendants
and
singers.
Behind
them
soldiers
and
officers
bore
a
large,
dark-faced
icon
with
an
embossed
metal
cover.
This
was
the
icon
that
had
been
brought
from
Smolensk
and
had
since
accompanied
the
army.
Behind,
before,
and
on
both
sides,
crowds
of
militiamen
with
bared
heads
walked,
ran,
and
bowed
to
the
ground.
At
the
summit
of
the
hill
they
stopped
with
the
icon;
the
men
who
had
been
holding
it
up
by
the
linen
bands
attached
to
it
were
relieved
by
others,
the
chanters
relit
their
censers,
and
service
began.
The
hot
rays
of
the
sun
beat
down
vertically
and
a
fresh
soft
wind
played
with
the
hair
of
the
bared
heads
and
with
the
ribbons
decorating
the
icon.
The
singing
did
not
sound
loud
under
the
open
sky.
An
immense
crowd
of
bareheaded
officers,
soldiers,
and
militiamen
surrounded
the
icon.
Behind
the
priest
and
a
chanter
stood
the
notabilities
on
a
spot
reserved
for
them.
A
bald
general
with
a
St.
George's
Cross
on
his
neck
stood
just
behind
the
priest's
back,
and
without
crossing
himself
(he
was
evidently
a
German)
patiently
awaited
the
end
of
the
service,
which
he
considered
it
necessary
to
hear
to
the
end,
probably
to
arouse
the
patriotism
of
the
Russian
people.
Another
general
stood
in
a
martial
pose,
crossing
himself
by
shaking
his
hand
in
front
of
his
chest
while
looking
about
him.
Standing
among
the
crowd
of
peasants,
Pierre
recognized
several
acquaintances
among
these
notables,
but
did
not
look
at
them--his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
in
watching
the
serious
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
crowd
of
soldiers
and
militiamen
who
were
all
gazing
eagerly
at
the
icon.
As
soon
as
the
tired
chanters,
who
were
singing
the
service
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day,
began
lazily
and
mechanically
to
sing:
"Save
from
calamity
Thy
servants,
O
Mother
of
God,"
and
the
priest
and
deacon
chimed
in:
"For
to
Thee
under
God
we
all
flee
as
to
an
inviolable
bulwark
and
protection,"
there
again
kindled
in
all
those
faces
the
same
expression
of
consciousness
of
the
solemnity
of
the
impending
moment
that
Pierre
had
seen
on
the
faces
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
Mozhaysk
and
momentarily
on
many
and
many
faces
he
had
met
that
morning;
and
heads
were
bowed
more
frequently
and
hair
tossed
back,
and
sighs
and
the
sound
men
made
as
they
crossed
themselves
were
heard.
The
crowd
round
the
icon
suddenly
parted
and
pressed
against
Pierre.
Someone,
a
very
important
personage
judging
by
the
haste
with
which
way
was
made
for
him,
was
approaching
the
icon.
It
was
Kutuzov,
who
had
been
riding
round
the
position
and
on
his
way
back
to
Tatarinova
had
stopped
where
the
service
was
being
held.
Pierre
recognized
him
at
once
by
his
peculiar
figure,
which
distinguished
him
from
everybody
else.
With
a
long
overcoat
on
his
exceedingly
stout,
round-shouldered
body,
with
uncovered
white
head
and
puffy
face
showing
the
white
ball
of
the
eye
he
had
lost,
Kutuzov
walked
with
plunging,
swaying
gait
into
the
crowd
and
stopped
behind
the
priest.
He
crossed
himself
with
an
accustomed
movement,
bent
till
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand,
and
bowed
his
white
head
with
a
deep
sigh.
Behind
Kutuzov
was
Bennigsen
and
the
suite.
Despite
the
presence
of
the
commander-in-chief,
who
attracted
the
attention
of
all
the
superior
officers,
the
militiamen
and
soldiers
continued
their
prayers
without
looking
at
him.
When
the
service
was
over,
Kutuzov
stepped
up
to
the
icon,
sank
heavily
to
his
knees,
bowed
to
the
ground,
and
for
a
long
time
tried
vainly
to
rise,
but
could
not
do
so
on
account
of
his
weakness
and
weight.
His
white
head
twitched
with
the
effort.
At
last
he
rose,
kissed
the
icon
as
a
child
does
with
naively
pouting
lips,
and
again
bowed
till
he
touched
the
ground
with
his
hand.
The
other
generals
followed
his
example,
then
the
officers,
and
after
them
with
excited
faces,
pressing
on
one
another,
crowding,
panting,
and
pushing,
scrambled
the
soldiers
and
militiamen.
CHAPTER
XXII
Staggering
amid
the
crush,
Pierre
looked
about
him.
"Count
Peter
Kirilovich!
How
did
you
get
here?"
said
a
voice.
Pierre
looked
round.
Boris
Drubetskoy,
brushing
his
knees
with
his
hand
(he
had
probably
soiled
them
when
he,
too,
had
knelt
before
the
icon),
came
up
to
him
smiling.
Boris
was
elegantly
dressed,
with
a
slightly
martial
touch
appropriate
to
a
campaign.
He
wore
a
long
coat
and
like
Kutuzov
had
a
whip
slung
across
his
shoulder.
Meanwhile
Kutuzov
had
reached
the
village
and
seated
himself
in
the
shade
of
the
nearest
house,
on
a
bench
which
one
Cossack
had
run
to
fetch
and
another
had
hastily
covered
with
a
rug.
An
immense
and
brilliant
suite
surrounded
him.
The
icon
was
carried
further,
accompanied
by
the
throng.
Pierre
stopped
some
thirty
paces
from
Kutuzov,
talking
to
Boris.
He
explained
his
wish
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
to
see
the
position.
"This
is
what
you
must
do,"
said
Boris.
"I
will
do
the
honors
of
the
camp
to
you.
You
will
see
everything
best
from
where
Count
Bennigsen
will
be.
I
am
in
attendance
on
him,
you
know;
I'll
mention
it
to
him.
But
if
you
want
to
ride
round
the
position,
come
along
with
us.
We
are
just
going
to
the
left
flank.
Then
when
we
get
back,
do
spend
the
night
with
me
and
we'll
arrange
a
game
of
cards.
Of
course
you
know
Dmitri
Sergeevich?
Those
are
his
quarters,"
and
he
pointed
to
the
third
house
in
the
village
of
Gorki.
"But
I
should
like
to
see
the
right
flank.
They
say
it's
very
strong,"
said
Pierre.
"I
should
like
to
start
from
the
Moskva
River
and
ride
round
the
whole
position."
"Well,
you
can
do
that
later,
but
the
chief
thing
is
the
left
flank."
"Yes,
yes.
But
where
is
Prince
Bolkonski's
regiment?
Can
you
point
it
out
to
me?"
"Prince
Andrew's?
We
shall
pass
it
and
I'll
take
you
to
him."
"What
about
the
left
flank?"
asked
Pierre
"To
tell
you
the
truth,
between
ourselves,
God
only
knows
what
state
our
left
flank
is
in,"
said
Boris
confidentially
lowering
his
voice.
"It
is
not
at
all
what
Count
Bennigsen
intended.
He
meant
to
fortify
that
knoll
quite
differently,
but..."
Boris
shrugged
his
shoulders,
"his
Serene
Highness
would
not
have
it,
or
someone
persuaded
him.
You
see..."
but
Boris
did
not
finish,
for
at
that
moment
Kaysarov,
Kutuzov's
adjutant,
came
up
to
Pierre.
"Ah,
Kaysarov!"
said
Boris,
addressing
him
with
an
unembarrassed
smile,
"I
was
just
trying
to
explain
our
position
to
the
count.
It
is
amazing
how
his
Serene
Highness
could
so
foresee
the
intentions
of
the
French!"
"You
mean
the
left
flank?"
asked
Kaysarov.
"Yes,
exactly;
the
left
flank
is
now
extremely
strong."
Though
Kutuzov
had
dismissed
all
unnecessary
men
from
the
staff,
Boris
had
contrived
to
remain
at
headquarters
after
the
changes.
He
had
established
himself
with
Count
Bennigsen,
who,
like
all
on
whom
Boris
had
been
in
attendance,
considered
young
Prince
Drubetskoy
an
invaluable
man.
In
the
higher
command
there
were
two
sharply
defined
parties:
Kutuzov's
party
and
that
of
Bennigsen,
the
chief
of
staff.
Boris
belonged
to
the
latter
and
no
one
else,
while
showing
servile
respect
to
Kutuzov,
could
so
create
an
impression
that
the
old
fellow
was
not
much
good
and
that
Bennigsen
managed
everything.
Now
the
decisive
moment
of
battle
had
come
when
Kutuzov
would
be
destroyed
and
the
power
pass
to
Bennigsen,
or
even
if
Kutuzov
won
the
battle
it
would
be
felt
that
everything
was
done
by
Bennigsen.
In
any
case
many
great
rewards
would
have
to
be
given
for
tomorrow's
action,
and
new
men
would
come
to
the
front.
So
Boris
was
full
of
nervous
vivacity
all
day.
After
Kaysarov,
others
whom
Pierre
knew
came
up
to
him,
and
he
had
not
time
to
reply
to
all
the
questions
about
Moscow
that
were
showered
upon
him,
or
to
listen
to
all
that
was
told
him.
The
faces
all
expressed
animation
and
apprehension,
but
it
seemed
to
Pierre
that
the
cause
of
the
excitement
shown
in
some
of
these
faces
lay
chiefly
in
questions
of
personal
success;
his
mind,
however,
was
occupied
by
the
different
expression
he
saw
on
other
faces--an
expression
that
spoke
not
of
personal
matters
but
of
the
universal
questions
of
life
and
death.
Kutuzov
noticed
Pierre's
figure
and
the
group
gathered
round
him.
"Call
him
to
me,"
said
Kutuzov.
An
adjutant
told
Pierre
of
his
Serene
Highness'
wish,
and
Pierre
went
toward
Kutuzov's
bench.
But
a
militiaman
got
there
before
him.
It
was
Dolokhov.
"How
did
that
fellow
get
here?"
asked
Pierre.
"He's
a
creature
that
wriggles
in
anywhere!"
was
the
answer.
"He
has
been
degraded,
you
know.
Now
he
wants
to
bob
up
again.
He's
been
proposing
some
scheme
or
other
and
has
crawled
into
the
enemy's
picket
line
at
night....
He's
a
brave
fellow."
Pierre
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
respectfully
to
Kutuzov.
"I
concluded
that
if
I
reported
to
your
Serene
Highness
you
might
send
me
away
or
say
that
you
knew
what
I
was
reporting,
but
then
I
shouldn't
lose
anything..."
Dolokhov
was
saying.
"Yes,
yes."
"But
if
I
were
right,
I
should
be
rendering
a
service
to
my
Fatherland
for
which
I
am
ready
to
die."
"Yes,
yes."
"And
should
your
Serene
Highness
require
a
man
who
will
not
spare
his
skin,
please
think
of
me....
Perhaps
I
may
prove
useful
to
your
Serene
Highness."
"Yes...
Yes..."
Kutuzov
repeated,
his
laughing
eye
narrowing
more
and
more
as
he
looked
at
Pierre.
Just
then
Boris,
with
his
courtierlike
adroitness,
stepped
up
to
Pierre's
side
near
Kutuzov
and
in
a
most
natural
manner,
without
raising
his
voice,
said
to
Pierre,
as
though
continuing
an
interrupted
conversation:
"The
militia
have
put
on
clean
white
shirts
to
be
ready
to
die.
What
heroism,
Count!"
Boris
evidently
said
this
to
Pierre
in
order
to
be
overheard
by
his
Serene
Highness.
He
knew
Kutuzov's
attention
would
be
caught
by
those
words,
and
so
it
was.
"What
are
you
saying
about
the
militia?"
he
asked
Boris.
"Preparing
for
tomorrow,
your
Serene
Highness--for
death--they
have
put
on
clean
shirts."
"Ah...
a
wonderful,
a
matchless
people!"
said
Kutuzov;
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
swayed
his
head.
"A
matchless
people!"
he
repeated
with
a
sigh.
"So
you
want
to
smell
gunpowder?"
he
said
to
Pierre.
"Yes,
it's
a
pleasant
smell.
I
have
the
honor
to
be
one
of
your
wife's
adorers.
Is
she
well?
My
quarters
are
at
your
service."
And
as
often
happens
with
old
people,
Kutuzov
began
looking
about
absent-mindedly
as
if
forgetting
all
he
wanted
to
say
or
do.
Then,
evidently
remembering
what
he
wanted,
he
beckoned
to
Andrew
Kaysarov,
his
adjutant's
brother.
"Those
verses...
those
verses
of
Marin's...
how
do
they
go,
eh?
Those
he
wrote
about
Gerakov:
'Lectures
for
the
corps
inditing'...
Recite
them,
recite
them!"
said
he,
evidently
preparing
to
laugh.
Kaysarov
recited....
Kutuzov
smilingly
nodded
his
head
to
the
rhythm
of
the
verses.
When
Pierre
had
left
Kutuzov,
Dolokhov
came
up
to
him
and
took
his
hand.
"I
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
here,
Count,"
he
said
aloud,
regardless
of
the
presence
of
strangers
and
in
a
particularly
resolute
and
solemn
tone.
"On
the
eve
of
a
day
when
God
alone
knows
who
of
us
is
fated
to
survive,
I
am
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
tell
you
that
I
regret
the
misunderstandings
that
occurred
between
us
and
should
wish
you
not
to
have
any
ill
feeling
for
me.
I
beg
you
to
forgive
me."
Pierre
looked
at
Dolokhov
with
a
smile,
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
him.
With
tears
in
his
eyes
Dolokhov
embraced
Pierre
and
kissed
him.
Boris
said
a
few
words
to
his
general,
and
Count
Bennigsen
turned
to
Pierre
and
proposed
that
he
should
ride
with
him
along
the
line.
"It
will
interest
you,"
said
he.
"Yes,
very
much,"
replied
Pierre.
Half
an
hour
later
Kutuzov
left
for
Tatarinova,
and
Bennigsen
and
his
suite,
with
Pierre
among
them,
set
out
on
their
ride
along
the
line.
CHAPTER
XXIII
From
Gorki,
Bennigsen
descended
the
highroad
to
the
bridge
which,
when
they
had
looked
at
it
from
the
hill,
the
officer
had
pointed
out
as
being
the
center
of
our
position
and
where
rows
of
fragrant
new-mown
hay
lay
by
the
riverside.
They
rode
across
that
bridge
into
the
village
of
Borodino
and
thence
turned
to
the
left,
passing
an
enormous
number
of
troops
and
guns,
and
came
to
a
high
knoll
where
militiamen
were
digging.
This
was
the
redoubt,
as
yet
unnamed,
which
afterwards
became
known
as
the
Raevski
Redoubt,
or
the
Knoll
Battery,
but
Pierre
paid
no
special
attention
to
it.
He
did
not
know
that
it
would
become
more
memorable
to
him
than
any
other
spot
on
the
plain
of
Borodino.
They
then
crossed
the
hollow
to
Semenovsk,
where
the
soldiers
were
dragging
away
the
last
logs
from
the
huts
and
barns.
Then
they
rode
downhill
and
uphill,
across
a
ryefield
trodden
and
beaten
down
as
if
by
hail,
following
a
track
freshly
made
by
the
artillery
over
the
furrows
of
the
plowed
land,
and
reached
some
fleches
*
which
were
still
being
dug.
*
A
kind
of
entrenchment.
At
the
fleches
Bennigsen
stopped
and
began
looking
at
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
opposite,
which
had
been
ours
the
day
before
and
where
several
horsemen
could
be
descried.
The
officers
said
that
either
Napoleon
or
Murat
was
there,
and
they
all
gazed
eagerly
at
this
little
group
of
horsemen.
Pierre
also
looked
at
them,
trying
to
guess
which
of
the
scarcely
discernible
figures
was
Napoleon.
At
last
those
mounted
men
rode
away
from
the
mound
and
disappeared.
Bennigsen
spoke
to
a
general
who
approached
him,
and
began
explaining
the
whole
position
of
our
troops.
Pierre
listened
to
him,
straining
each
faculty
to
understand
the
essential
points
of
the
impending
battle,
but
was
mortified
to
feel
that
his
mental
capacity
was
inadequate
for
the
task.
He
could
make
nothing
of
it.
Bennigsen
stopped
speaking
and,
noticing
that
Pierre
was
listening,
suddenly
said
to
him:
"I
don't
think
this
interests
you?"
"On
the
contrary
it's
very
interesting!"
replied
Pierre
not
quite
truthfully.
From
the
fleches
they
rode
still
farther
to
the
left,
along
a
road
winding
through
a
thick,
low-growing
birch
wood.
In
the
middle
of
the
wood
a
brown
hare
with
white
feet
sprang
out
and,
scared
by
the
tramp
of
the
many
horses,
grew
so
confused
that
it
leaped
along
the
road
in
front
of
them
for
some
time,
arousing
general
attention
and
laughter,
and
only
when
several
voices
shouted
at
it
did
it
dart
to
one
side
and
disappear
in
the
thicket.
After
going
through
the
wood
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
they
came
out
on
a
glade
where
troops
of
Tuchkov's
corps
were
stationed
to
defend
the
left
flank.
Here,
at
the
extreme
left
flank,
Bennigsen
talked
a
great
deal
and
with
much
heat,
and,
as
it
seemed
to
Pierre,
gave
orders
of
great
military
importance.
In
front
of
Tuchkov's
troops
was
some
high
ground
not
occupied
by
troops.
Bennigsen
loudly
criticized
this
mistake,
saying
that
it
was
madness
to
leave
a
height
which
commanded
the
country
around
unoccupied
and
to
place
troops
below
it.
Some
of
the
generals
expressed
the
same
opinion.
One
in
particular
declared
with
martial
heat
that
they
were
put
there
to
be
slaughtered.
Bennigsen
on
his
own
authority
ordered
the
troops
to
occupy
the
high
ground.
This
disposition
on
the
left
flank
increased
Pierre's
doubt
of
his
own
capacity
to
understand
military
matters.
Listening
to
Bennigsen
and
the
generals
criticizing
the
position
of
the
troops
behind
the
hill,
he
quite
understood
them
and
shared
their
opinion,
but
for
that
very
reason
he
could
not
understand
how
the
man
who
put
them
there
behind
the
hill
could
have
made
so
gross
and
palpable
a
blunder.
Pierre
did
not
know
that
these
troops
were
not,
as
Bennigsen
supposed,
put
there
to
defend
the
position,
but
were
in
a
concealed
position
as
an
ambush,
that
they
should
not
be
seen
and
might
be
able
to
strike
an
approaching
enemy
unexpectedly.
Bennigsen
did
not
know
this
and
moved
the
troops
forward
according
to
his
own
ideas
without
mentioning
the
matter
to
the
commander-in-chief.
CHAPTER
XXIV
On
that
bright
evening
of
August
25,
Prince
Andrew
lay
leaning
on
his
elbow
in
a
broken-down
shed
in
the
village
of
Knyazkovo
at
the
further
end
of
his
regiment's
encampment.
Through
a
gap
in
the
broken
wall
he
could
see,
beside
the
wooden
fence,
a
row
of
thirty
year-old
birches
with
their
lower
branches
lopped
off,
a
field
on
which
shocks
of
oats
were
standing,
and
some
bushes
near
which
rose
the
smoke
of
campfires--
the
soldiers'
kitchens.
Narrow
and
burdensome
and
useless
to
anyone
as
his
life
now
seemed
to
him,
Prince
Andrew
on
the
eve
of
battle
felt
agitated
and
irritable
as
he
had
done
seven
years
before
at
Austerlitz.
He
had
received
and
given
the
orders
for
next
day's
battle
and
had
nothing
more
to
do.
But
his
thoughts--the
simplest,
clearest,
and
therefore
most
terrible
thoughts--would
give
him
no
peace.
He
knew
that
tomorrow's
battle
would
be
the
most
terrible
of
all
he
had
taken
part
in,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
possibility
of
death
presented
itself
to
him--not
in
relation
to
any
worldly
matter
or
with
reference
to
its
effect
on
others,
but
simply
in
relation
to
himself,
to
his
own
soul--vividly,
plainly,
terribly,
and
almost
as
a
certainty.
And
from
the
height
of
this
perception
all
that
had
previously
tormented
and
preoccupied
him
suddenly
became
illumined
by
a
cold
white
light
without
shadows,
without
perspective,
without
distinction
of
outline.
All
life
appeared
to
him
like
magic-lantern
pictures
at
which
he
had
long
been
gazing
by
artificial
light
through
a
glass.
Now
he
suddenly
saw
those
badly
daubed
pictures
in
clear
daylight
and
without
a
glass.
"Yes,
yes!
There
they
are,
those
false
images
that
agitated,
enraptured,
and
tormented
me,"
said
he
to
himself,
passing
in
review
the
principal
pictures
of
the
magic
lantern
of
life
and
regarding
them
now
in
the
cold
white
daylight
of
his
clear
perception
of
death.
"There
they
are,
those
rudely
painted
figures
that
once
seemed
splendid
and
mysterious.
Glory,
the
good
of
society,
love
of
a
woman,
the
Fatherland
itself--how
important
these
pictures
appeared
to
me,
with
what
profound
meaning
they
seemed
to
be
filled!
And
it
is
all
so
simple,
pale,
and
crude
in
the
cold
white
light
of
this
morning
which
I
feel
is
dawning
for
me."
The
three
great
sorrows
of
his
life
held
his
attention
in
particular:
his
love
for
a
woman,
his
father's
death,
and
the
French
invasion
which
had
overrun
half
Russia.
"Love...
that
little
girl
who
seemed
to
me
brimming
over
with
mystic
forces!
Yes,
indeed,
I
loved
her.
I
made
romantic
plans
of
love
and
happiness
with
her!
Oh,
what
a
boy
I
was!"
he
said
aloud
bitterly.
"Ah
me!
I
believed
in
some
ideal
love
which
was
to
keep
her
faithful
to
me
for
the
whole
year
of
my
absence!
Like
the
gentle
dove
in
the
fable
she
was
to
pine
apart
from
me....
But
it
was
much
simpler
really....
It
was
all
very
simple
and
horrible."
"When
my
father
built
Bald
Hills
he
thought
the
place
was
his:
his
land,
his
air,
his
peasants.
But
Napoleon
came
and
swept
him
aside,
unconscious
of
his
existence,
as
he
might
brush
a
chip
from
his
path,
and
his
Bald
Hills
and
his
whole
life
fell
to
pieces.
Princess
Mary
says
it
is
a
trial
sent
from
above.
What
is
the
trial
for,
when
he
is
not
here
and
will
never
return?
He
is
not
here!
For
whom
then
is
the
trial
intended?
The
Fatherland,
the
destruction
of
Moscow!
And
tomorrow
I
shall
be
killed,
perhaps
not
even
by
a
Frenchman
but
by
one
of
our
own
men,
by
a
soldier
discharging
a
musket
close
to
my
ear
as
one
of
them
did
yesterday,
and
the
French
will
come
and
take
me
by
head
and
heels
and
fling
me
into
a
hole
that
I
may
not
stink
under
their
noses,
and
new
conditions
of
life
will
arise,
which
will
seem
quite
ordinary
to
others
and
about
which
I
shall
know
nothing.
I
shall
not
exist..."
He
looked
at
the
row
of
birches
shining
in
the
sunshine,
with
their
motionless
green
and
yellow
foliage
and
white
bark.
"To
die...
to
be
killed
tomorrow...
That
I
should
not
exist...
That
all
this
should
still
be,
but
no
me...."
And
the
birches
with
their
light
and
shade,
the
curly
clouds,
the
smoke
of
the
campfires,
and
all
that
was
around
him
changed
and
seemed
terrible
and
menacing.
A
cold
shiver
ran
down
his
spine.
He
rose
quickly,
went
out
of
the
shed,
and
began
to
walk
about.
After
he
had
returned,
voices
were
heard
outside
the
shed.
"Who's
that?"
he
cried.
The
red-nosed
Captain
Timokhin,
formerly
Dolokhov's
squadron
commander,
but
now
from
lack
of
officers
a
battalion
commander,
shyly
entered
the
shed
followed
by
an
adjutant
and
the
regimental
paymaster.
Prince
Andrew
rose
hastily,
listened
to
the
business
they
had
come
about,
gave
them
some
further
instructions,
and
was
about
to
dismiss
them
when
he
heard
a
familiar,
lisping,
voice
behind
the
shed.
"Devil
take
it!"
said
the
voice
of
a
man
stumbling
over
something.
Prince
Andrew
looked
out
of
the
shed
and
saw
Pierre,
who
had
tripped
over
a
pole
on
the
ground
and
had
nearly
fallen,
coming
his
way.
It
was
unpleasant
to
Prince
Andrew
to
meet
people
of
his
own
set
in
general,
and
Pierre
especially,
for
he
reminded
him
of
all
the
painful
moments
of
his
last
visit
to
Moscow.
"You?
What
a
surprise!"
said
he.
"What
brings
you
here?
This
is
unexpected!"
As
he
said
this
his
eyes
and
face
expressed
more
than
coldness--they
expressed
hostility,
which
Pierre
noticed
at
once.
He
had
approached
the
shed
full
of
animation,
but
on
seeing
Prince
Andrew's
face
he
felt
constrained
and
ill
at
ease.
"I
have
come...
simply...
you
know...
come...
it
interests
me,"
said
Pierre,
who
had
so
often
that
day
senselessly
repeated
that
word
"interesting."
"I
wish
to
see
the
battle."
"Oh
yes,
and
what
do
the
masonic
brothers
say
about
war?
How
would
they
stop
it?"
said
Prince
Andrew
sarcastically.
"Well,
and
how's
Moscow?
And
my
people?
Have
they
reached
Moscow
at
last?"
he
asked
seriously.
"Yes,
they
have.
Julie
Drubetskaya
told
me
so.
I
went
to
see
them,
but
missed
them.
They
have
gone
to
your
estate
near
Moscow."
CHAPTER
XXV
The
officers
were
about
to
take
leave,
but
Prince
Andrew,
apparently
reluctant
to
be
left
alone
with
his
friend,
asked
them
to
stay
and
have
tea.
Seats
were
brought
in
and
so
was
the
tea.
The
officers
gazed
with
surprise
at
Pierre's
huge
stout
figure
and
listened
to
his
talk
of
Moscow
and
the
position
of
our
army,
round
which
he
had
ridden.
Prince
Andrew
remained
silent,
and
his
expression
was
so
forbidding
that
Pierre
addressed
his
remarks
chiefly
to
the
good-natured
battalion
commander.
"So
you
understand
the
whole
position
of
our
troops?"
Prince
Andrew
interrupted
him.
"Yes--that
is,
how
do
you
mean?"
said
Pierre.
"Not
being
a
military
man
I
can't
say
I
have
understood
it
fully,
but
I
understand
the
general
position."
"Well,
then,
you
know
more
than
anyone
else,
be
it
who
it
may,"
said
Prince
Andrew.
"Oh!"
said
Pierre,
looking
over
his
spectacles
in
perplexity
at
Prince
Andrew.
"Well,
and
what
do
you
think
of
Kutuzov's
appointment?"
he
asked.
"I
was
very
glad
of
his
appointment,
that's
all
I
know,"
replied
Prince
Andrew.
"And
tell
me
your
opinion
of
Barclay
de
Tolly.
In
Moscow
they
are
saying
heaven
knows
what
about
him....
What
do
you
think
of
him?"
"Ask
them,"
replied
Prince
Andrew,
indicating
the
officers.
Pierre
looked
at
Timokhin
with
the
condescendingly
interrogative
smile
with
which
everybody
involuntarily
addressed
that
officer.
"We
see
light
again,
since
his
Serenity
has
been
appointed,
your
excellency,"
said
Timokhin
timidly,
and
continually
turning
to
glance
at
his
colonel.
"Why
so?"
asked
Pierre.
"Well,
to
mention
only
firewood
and
fodder,
let
me
inform
you.
Why,
when
we
were
retreating
from
Sventsyani
we
dare
not
touch
a
stick
or
a
wisp
of
hay
or
anything.
You
see,
we
were
going
away,
so
he
would
get
it
all;
wasn't
it
so,
your
excellency?"
and
again
Timokhin
turned
to
the
prince.
"But
we
daren't.
In
our
regiment
two
officers
were
court-martialed
for
that
kind
of
thing.
But
when
his
Serenity
took
command
everything
became
straight
forward.
Now
we
see
light..."
"Then
why
was
it
forbidden?"
Timokhin
looked
about
in
confusion,
not
knowing
what
or
how
to
answer
such
a
question.
Pierre
put
the
same
question
to
Prince
Andrew.
"Why,
so
as
not
to
lay
waste
the
country
we
were
abandoning
to
the
enemy,"
said
Prince
Andrew
with
venomous
irony.
"It
is
very
sound:
one
can't
permit
the
land
to
be
pillaged
and
accustom
the
troops
to
marauding.
At
Smolensk
too
he
judged
correctly
that
the
French
might
outflank
us,
as
they
had
larger
forces.
But
he
could
not
understand
this,"
cried
Prince
Andrew
in
a
shrill
voice
that
seemed
to
escape
him
involuntarily:
"he
could
not
understand
that
there,
for
the
first
time,
we
were
fighting
for
Russian
soil,
and
that
there
was
a
spirit
in
the
men
such
as
I
had
never
seen
before,
that
we
had
held
the
French
for
two
days,
and
that
that
success
had
increased
our
strength
tenfold.
He
ordered
us
to
retreat,
and
all
our
efforts
and
losses
went
for
nothing.
He
had
no
thought
of
betraying
us,
he
tried
to
do
the
best
he
could,
he
thought
out
everything,
and
that
is
why
he
is
unsuitable.
He
is
unsuitable
now,
just
because
he
plans
out
everything
very
thoroughly
and
accurately
as
every
German
has
to.
How
can
I
explain?...
Well,
say
your
father
has
a
German
valet,
and
he
is
a
splendid
valet
and
satisfies
your
father's
requirements
better
than
you
could,
then
it's
all
right
to
let
him
serve.
But
if
your
father
is
mortally
sick
you'll
send
the
valet
away
and
attend
to
your
father
with
your
own
unpracticed,
awkward
hands,
and
will
soothe
him
better
than
a
skilled
man
who
is
a
stranger
could.
So
it
has
been
with
Barclay.
While
Russia
was
well,
a
foreigner
could
serve
her
and
be
a
splendid
minister;
but
as
soon
as
she
is
in
danger
she
needs
one
of
her
own
kin.
But
in
your
club
they
have
been
making
him
out
a
traitor!
They
slander
him
as
a
traitor,
and
the
only
result
will
be
that
afterwards,
ashamed
of
their
false
accusations,
they
will
make
him
out
a
hero
or
a
genius
instead
of
a
traitor,
and
that
will
be
still
more
unjust.
He
is
an
honest
and
very
punctilious
German."
"And
they
say
he's
a
skillful
commander,"
rejoined
Pierre.
"I
don't
understand
what
is
meant
by
'a
skillful
commander,'"
replied
Prince
Andrew
ironically.
"A
skillful
commander?"
replied
Pierre.
"Why,
one
who
foresees
all
contingencies...
and
foresees
the
adversary's
intentions."
"But
that's
impossible,"
said
Prince
Andrew
as
if
it
were
a
matter
settled
long
ago.
Pierre
looked
at
him
in
surprise.
"And
yet
they
say
that
war
is
like
a
game
of
chess?"
he
remarked.
"Yes,"
replied
Prince
Andrew,
"but
with
this
little
difference,
that
in
chess
you
may
think
over
each
move
as
long
as
you
please
and
are
not
limited
for
time,
and
with
this
difference
too,
that
a
knight
is
always
stronger
than
a
pawn,
and
two
pawns
are
always
stronger
than
one,
while
in
war
a
battalion
is
sometimes
stronger
than
a
division
and
sometimes
weaker
than
a
company.
The
relative
strength
of
bodies
of
troops
can
never
be
known
to
anyone.
Believe
me,"
he
went
on,
"if
things
depended
on
arrangements
made
by
the
staff,
I
should
be
there
making
arrangements,
but
instead
of
that
I
have
the
honor
to
serve
here
in
the
regiment
with
these
gentlemen,
and
I
consider
that
on
us
tomorrow's
battle
will
depend
and
not
on
those
others....
Success
never
depends,
and
never
will
depend,
on
position,
or
equipment,
or
even
on
numbers,
and
least
of
all
on
position."
"But
on
what
then?"
"On
the
feeling
that
is
in
me
and
in
him,"
he
pointed
to
Timokhin,
"and
in
each
soldier."
Prince
Andrew
glanced
at
Timokhin,
who
looked
at
his
commander
in
alarm
and
bewilderment.
In
contrast
to
his
former
reticent
taciturnity
Prince
Andrew
now
seemed
excited.
He
could
apparently
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
thoughts
that
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him.
"A
battle
is
won
by
those
who
firmly
resolve
to
win
it!
Why
did
we
lose
the
battle
at
Austerlitz?
The
French
losses
were
almost
equal
to
ours,
but
very
early
we
said
to
ourselves
that
we
were
losing
the
battle,
and
we
did
lose
it.
And
we
said
so
because
we
had
nothing
to
fight
for
there,
we
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
battlefield
as
soon
as
we
could.
'We've
lost,
so
let
us
run,'
and
we
ran.
If
we
had
not
said
that
till
the
evening,
heaven
knows
what
might
not
have
happened.
But
tomorrow
we
shan't
say
it!
You
talk
about
our
position,
the
left
flank
weak
and
the
right
flank
too
extended,"
he
went
on.
"That's
all
nonsense,
there's
nothing
of
the
kind.
But
what
awaits
us
tomorrow?
A
hundred
million
most
diverse
chances
which
will
be
decided
on
the
instant
by
the
fact
that
our
men
or
theirs
run
or
do
not
run,
and
that
this
man
or
that
man
is
killed,
but
all
that
is
being
done
at
present
is
only
play.
The
fact
is
that
those
men
with
whom
you
have
ridden
round
the
position
not
only
do
not
help
matters,
but
hinder.
They
are
only
concerned
with
their
own
petty
interests."
"At
such
a
moment?"
said
Pierre
reproachfully.
"At
such
a
moment!"
Prince
Andrew
repeated.
"To
them
it
is
only
a
moment
affording
opportunities
to
undermine
a
rival
and
obtain
an
extra
cross
or
ribbon.
For
me
tomorrow
means
this:
a
Russian
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
and
a
French
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
have
met
to
fight,
and
the
thing
is
that
these
two
hundred
thousand
men
will
fight
and
the
side
that
fights
more
fiercely
and
spares
itself
least
will
win.
And
if
you
like
I
will
tell
you
that
whatever
happens
and
whatever
muddles
those
at
the
top
may
make,
we
shall
win
tomorrow's
battle.
Tomorrow,
happen
what
may,
we
shall
win!"
"There
now,
your
excellency!
That's
the
truth,
the
real
truth,"
said
Timokhin.
"Who
would
spare
himself
now?
The
soldiers
in
my
battalion,
believe
me,
wouldn't
drink
their
vodka!
'It's
not
the
day
for
that!'
they
say."
All
were
silent.
The
officers
rose.
Prince
Andrew
went
out
of
the
shed
with
them,
giving
final
orders
to
the
adjutant.
After
they
had
gone
Pierre
approached
Prince
Andrew
and
was
about
to
start
a
conversation
when
they
heard
the
clatter
of
three
horses'
hoofs
on
the
road
not
far
from
the
shed,
and
looking
in
that
direction
Prince
Andrew
recognized
Wolzogen
and
Clausewitz
accompanied
by
a
Cossack.
They
rode
close
by
continuing
to
converse,
and
Prince
Andrew
involuntarily
heard
these
words:
"Der
Krieg
muss
in
Raum
verlegt
werden.
Der
Ansicht
kann
ich
nicht
genug
Preis
geben,"
*
said
one
of
them.
*
"The
war
must
be
extended
widely.
I
cannot
sufficiently
commend
that
view."
"Oh,
ja,"
said
the
other,
"der
Zweck
ist
nur
den
Feind
zu
schwaechen,
so
kann
man
gewiss
nicht
den
Verlust
der
Privat-Personen
in
Achtung
nehmen."
*
*
"Oh,
yes,
the
only
aim
is
to
weaken
the
enemy,
so
of
course
one
cannot
take
into
account
the
loss
of
private
individuals."
"Oh,
no,"
agreed
the
other.
"Extend
widely!"
said
Prince
Andrew
with
an
angry
snort,
when
they
had
ridden
past.
"In
that
'extend'
were
my
father,
son,
and
sister,
at
Bald
Hills.
That's
all
the
same
to
him!
That's
what
I
was
saying
to
you--
those
German
gentlemen
won't
win
the
battle
tomorrow
but
will
only
make
all
the
mess
they
can,
because
they
have
nothing
in
their
German
heads
but
theories
not
worth
an
empty
eggshell
and
haven't
in
their
hearts
the
one
thing
needed
tomorrow--that
which
Timokhin
has.
They
have
yielded
up
all
Europe
to
him,
and
have
now
come
to
teach
us.
Fine
teachers!"
and
again
his
voice
grew
shrill.
"So
you
think
we
shall
win
tomorrow's
battle?"
asked
Pierre.
"Yes,
yes,"
answered
Prince
Andrew
absently.
"One
thing
I
would
do
if
I
had
the
power,"
he
began
again,
"I
would
not
take
prisoners.
Why
take
prisoners?
It's
chivalry!
The
French
have
destroyed
my
home
and
are
on
their
way
to
destroy
Moscow,
they
have
outraged
and
are
outraging
me
every
moment.
They
are
my
enemies.
In
my
opinion
they
are
all
criminals.
And
so
thinks
Timokhin
and
the
whole
army.
They
should
be
executed!
Since
they
are
my
foes
they
cannot
be
my
friends,
whatever
may
have
been
said
at
Tilsit."
"Yes,
yes,"
muttered
Pierre,
looking
with
shining
eyes
at
Prince
Andrew.
"I
quite
agree
with
you!"
The
question
that
had
perturbed
Pierre
on
the
Mozhaysk
hill
and
all
that
day
now
seemed
to
him
quite
clear
and
completely
solved.
He
now
understood
the
whole
meaning
and
importance
of
this
war
and
of
the
impending
battle.
All
he
had
seen
that
day,
all
the
significant
and
stern
expressions
on
the
faces
he
had
seen
in
passing,
were
lit
up
for
him
by
a
new
light.
He
understood
that
latent
heat
(as
they
say
in
physics)
of
patriotism
which
was
present
in
all
these
men
he
had
seen,
and
this
explained
to
him
why
they
all
prepared
for
death
calmly,
and
as
it
were
lightheartedly.
"Not
take
prisoners,"
Prince
Andrew
continued:
"That
by
itself
would
quite
change
the
whole
war
and
make
it
less
cruel.
As
it
is
we
have
played
at
war--that's
what's
vile!
We
play
at
magnanimity
and
all
that
stuff.
Such
magnanimity
and
sensibility
are
like
the
magnanimity
and
sensibility
of
a
lady
who
faints
when
she
sees
a
calf
being
killed:
she
is
so
kindhearted
that
she
can't
look
at
blood,
but
enjoys
eating
the
calf
served
up
with
sauce.
They
talk
to
us
of
the
rules
of
war,
of
chivalry,
of
flags
of
truce,
of
mercy
to
the
unfortunate
and
so
on.
It's
all
rubbish!
I
saw
chivalry
and
flags
of
truce
in
1805;
they
humbugged
us
and
we
humbugged
them.
They
plunder
other
people's
houses,
issue
false
paper
money,
and
worst
of
all
they
kill
my
children
and
my
father,
and
then
talk
of
rules
of
war
and
magnanimity
to
foes!
Take
no
prisoners,
but
kill
and
be
killed!
He
who
has
come
to
this
as
I
have
through
the
same
sufferings..."
Prince
Andrew,
who
had
thought
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
or
not
Moscow
was
taken
as
Smolensk
had
been,
was
suddenly
checked
in
his
speech
by
an
unexpected
cramp
in
his
throat.
He
paced
up
and
down
a
few
times
in
silence,
but
his
eyes
glittered
feverishly
and
his
lips
quivered
as
he
began
speaking.
"If
there
was
none
of
this
magnanimity
in
war,
we
should
go
to
war
only
when
it
was
worth
while
going
to
certain
death,
as
now.
Then
there
would
not
be
war
because
Paul
Ivanovich
had
offended
Michael
Ivanovich.
And
when
there
was
a
war,
like
this
one,
it
would
be
war!
And
then
the
determination
of
the
troops
would
be
quite
different.
Then
all
these
Westphalians
and
Hessians
whom
Napoleon
is
leading
would
not
follow
him
into
Russia,
and
we
should
not
go
to
fight
in
Austria
and
Prussia
without
knowing
why.
War
is
not
courtesy
but
the
most
horrible
thing
in
life;
and
we
ought
to
understand
that
and
not
play
at
war.
We
ought
to
accept
this
terrible
necessity
sternly
and
seriously.
It
all
lies
in
that:
get
rid
of
falsehood
and
let
war
be
war
and
not
a
game.
As
it
is
now,
war
is
the
favorite
pastime
of
the
idle
and
frivolous.
The
military
calling
is
the
most
highly
honored.
"But
what
is
war?
What
is
needed
for
success
in
warfare?
What
are
the
habits
of
the
military?
The
aim
of
war
is
murder;
the
methods
of
war
are
spying,
treachery,
and
their
encouragement,
the
ruin
of
a
country's
inhabitants,
robbing
them
or
stealing
to
provision
the
army,
and
fraud
and
falsehood
termed
military
craft.
The
habits
of
the
military
class
are
the
absence
of
freedom,
that
is,
discipline,
idleness,
ignorance,
cruelty,
debauchery,
and
drunkenness.
And
in
spite
of
all
this
it
is
the
highest
class,
respected
by
everyone.
All
the
kings,
except
the
Chinese,
wear
military
uniforms,
and
he
who
kills
most
people
receives
the
highest
rewards.
"They
meet,
as
we
shall
meet
tomorrow,
to
murder
one
another;
they
kill
and
maim
tens
of
thousands,
and
then
have
thanksgiving
services
for
having
killed
so
many
people
(they
even
exaggerate
the
number),
and
they
announce
a
victory,
supposing
that
the
more
people
they
have
killed
the
greater
their
achievement.
How
does
God
above
look
at
them
and
hear
them?"
exclaimed
Prince
Andrew
in
a
shrill,
piercing
voice.
"Ah,
my
friend,
it
has
of
late
become
hard
for
me
to
live.
I
see
that
I
have
begun
to
understand
too
much.
And
it
doesn't
do
for
man
to
taste
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil....
Ah,
well,
it's
not
for
long!"
he
added.
"However,
you're
sleepy,
and
it's
time
for
me
to
sleep.
Go
back
to
Gorki!"
said
Prince
Andrew
suddenly.
"Oh
no!"
Pierre
replied,
looking
at
Prince
Andrew
with
frightened,
compassionate
eyes.
"Go,
go!
Before
a
battle
one
must
have
one's
sleep
out,"
repeated
Prince
Andrew.
He
came
quickly
up
to
Pierre
and
embraced
and
kissed
him.
"Good-bye,
be
off!"
he
shouted.
"Whether
we
meet
again
or
not..."
and
turning
away
hurriedly
he
entered
the
shed.
It
was
already
dark,
and
Pierre
could
not
make
out
whether
the
expression
of
Prince
Andrew's
face
was
angry
or
tender.
For
some
time
he
stood
in
silence
considering
whether
he
should
follow
him
or
go
away.
"No,
he
does
not
want
it!"
Pierre
concluded.
"And
I
know
that
this
is
our
last
meeting!"
He
sighed
deeply
and
rode
back
to
Gorki.
On
re-entering
the
shed
Prince
Andrew
lay
down
on
a
rug,
but
he
could
not
sleep.
He
closed
his
eyes.
One
picture
succeeded
another
in
his
imagination.
On
one
of
them
he
dwelt
long
and
joyfully.
He
vividly
recalled
an
evening
in
Petersburg.
Natasha
with
animated
and
excited
face
was
telling
him
how
she
had
gone
to
look
for
mushrooms
the
previous
summer
and
had
lost
her
way
in
the
big
forest.
She
incoherently
described
the
depths
of
the
forest,
her
feelings,
and
a
talk
with
a
beekeeper
she
met,
and
constantly
interrupted
her
story
to
say:
"No,
I
can't!
I'm
not
telling
it
right;
no,
you
don't
understand,"
though
he
encouraged
her
by
saying
that
he
did
understand,
and
he
really
had
understood
all
she
wanted
to
say.
But
Natasha
was
not
satisfied
with
her
own
words:
she
felt
that
they
did
not
convey
the
passionately
poetic
feeling
she
had
experienced
that
day
and
wished
to
convey.
"He
was
such
a
delightful
old
man,
and
it
was
so
dark
in
the
forest...
and
he
had
such
kind...
No,
I
can't
describe
it,"
she
had
said,
flushed
and
excited.
Prince
Andrew
smiled
now
the
same
happy
smile
as
then
when
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes.
"I
understood
her,"
he
thought.
"I
not
only
understood
her,
but
it
was
just
that
inner,
spiritual
force,
that
sincerity,
that
frankness
of
soul--
that
very
soul
of
hers
which
seemed
to
be
fettered
by
her
body--it
was
that
soul
I
loved
in
her...
loved
so
strongly
and
happily..."
and
suddenly
he
remembered
how
his
love
had
ended.
"He
did
not
need
anything
of
that
kind.
He
neither
saw
nor
understood
anything
of
the
sort.
He
only
saw
in
her
a
pretty
and
fresh
young
girl,
with
whom
he
did
not
deign
to
unite
his
fate.
And
I?...
and
he
is
still
alive
and
gay!"
Prince
Andrew
jumped
up
as
if
someone
had
burned
him,
and
again
began
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
shed.
CHAPTER
XXVI
On
August
25,
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
Borodino,
M.
de
Beausset,
prefect
of
the
French
Emperor's
palace,
arrived
at
Napoleon's
quarters
at
Valuevo
with
Colonel
Fabvier,
the
former
from
Paris
and
the
latter
from
Madrid.
Donning
his
court
uniform,
M.
de
Beausset
ordered
a
box
he
had
brought
for
the
Emperor
to
be
carried
before
him
and
entered
the
first
compartment
of
Napoleon's
tent,
where
he
began
opening
the
box
while
conversing
with
Napoleon's
aides-de-camp
who
surrounded
him.
Fabvier,
not
entering
the
tent,
remained
at
the
entrance
talking
to
some
generals
of
his
acquaintance.
The
Emperor
Napoleon
had
not
yet
left
his
bedroom
and
was
finishing
his
toilet.
Slightly
snorting
and
grunting,
he
presented
now
his
back
and
now
his
plump
hairy
chest
to
the
brush
with
which
his
valet
was
rubbing
him
down.
Another
valet,
with
his
finger
over
the
mouth
of
a
bottle,
was
sprinkling
Eau
de
Cologne
on
the
Emperor's
pampered
body
with
an
expression
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
alone
knew
where
and
how
much
Eau
de
Cologne
should
be
sprinkled.
Napoleon's
short
hair
was
wet
and
matted
on
the
forehead,
but
his
face,
though
puffy
and
yellow,
expressed
physical
satisfaction.
"Go
on,
harder,
go
on!"
he
muttered
to
the
valet
who
was
rubbing
him,
slightly
twitching
and
grunting.
An
aide-de-camp,
who
had
entered
the
bedroom
to
report
to
the
Emperor
the
number
of
prisoners
taken
in
yesterday's
action,
was
standing
by
the
door
after
delivering
his
message,
awaiting
permission
to
withdraw.
Napoleon,
frowning,
looked
at
him
from
under
his
brows.
"No
prisoners!"
said
he,
repeating
the
aide-de-camp's
words.
"They
are
forcing
us
to
exterminate
them.
So
much
the
worse
for
the
Russian
army....
Go
on...
harder,
harder!"
he
muttered,
hunching
his
back
and
presenting
his
fat
shoulders.
"All
right.
Let
Monsieur
de
Beausset
enter,
and
Fabvier
too,"
he
said,
nodding
to
the
aide-de-camp.
"Yes,
sire,"
and
the
aide-de-camp
disappeared
through
the
door
of
the
tent.
Two
valets
rapidly
dressed
His
Majesty,
and
wearing
the
blue
uniform
of
the
Guards
he
went
with
firm
quick
steps
to
the
reception
room.
De
Beausset's
hands
meanwhile
were
busily
engaged
arranging
the
present
he
had
brought
from
the
Empress,
on
two
chairs
directly
in
front
of
the
entrance.
But
Napoleon
had
dressed
and
come
out
with
such
unexpected
rapidity
that
he
had
not
time
to
finish
arranging
the
surprise.
Napoleon
noticed
at
once
what
they
were
about
and
guessed
that
they
were
not
ready.
He
did
not
wish
to
deprive
them
of
the
pleasure
of
giving
him
a
surprise,
so
he
pretended
not
to
see
de
Beausset
and
called
Fabvier
to
him,
listening
silently
and
with
a
stern
frown
to
what
Fabvier
told
him
of
the
heroism
and
devotion
of
his
troops
fighting
at
Salamanca,
at
the
other
end
of
Europe,
with
but
one
thought--to
be
worthy
of
their
Emperor--and
but
one
fear--to
fail
to
please
him.
The
result
of
that
battle
had
been
deplorable.
Napoleon
made
ironic
remarks
during
Fabvier's
account,
as
if
he
had
not
expected
that
matters
could
go
otherwise
in
his
absence.
"I
must
make
up
for
that
in
Moscow,"
said
Napoleon.
"I'll
see
you
later,"
he
added,
and
summoned
de
Beausset,
who
by
that
time
had
prepared
the
surprise,
having
placed
something
on
the
chairs
and
covered
it
with
a
cloth.
De
Beausset
bowed
low,
with
that
courtly
French
bow
which
only
the
old
retainers
of
the
Bourbons
knew
how
to
make,
and
approached
him,
presenting
an
envelope.
Napoleon
turned
to
him
gaily
and
pulled
his
ear.
"You
have
hurried
here.
I
am
very
glad.
Well,
what
is
Paris
saying?"
he
asked,
suddenly
changing
his
former
stern
expression
for
a
most
cordial
tone.
"Sire,
all
Paris
regrets
your
absence,"
replied
de
Beausset
as
was
proper.
But
though
Napoleon
knew
that
de
Beausset
had
to
say
something
of
this
kind,
and
though
in
his
lucid
moments
he
knew
it
was
untrue,
he
was
pleased
to
hear
it
from
him.
Again
he
honored
him
by
touching
his
ear.
"I
am
very
sorry
to
have
made
you
travel
so
far,"
said
he.
"Sire,
I
expected
nothing
less
than
to
find
you
at
the
gates
of
Moscow,"
replied
de
Beausset.
Napoleon
smiled
and,
lifting
his
head
absent-mindedly,
glanced
to
the
right.
An
aide-de-camp
approached
with
gliding
steps
and
offered
him
a
gold
snuffbox,
which
he
took.
"Yes,
it
has
happened
luckily
for
you,"
he
said,
raising
the
open
snuffbox
to
his
nose.
"You
are
fond
of
travel,
and
in
three
days
you
will
see
Moscow.
You
surely
did
not
expect
to
see
that
Asiatic
capital.
You
will
have
a
pleasant
journey."
De
Beausset
bowed
gratefully
at
this
regard
for
his
taste
for
travel
(of
which
he
had
not
till
then
been
aware).
"Ha,
what's
this?"
asked
Napoleon,
noticing
that
all
the
courtiers
were
looking
at
something
concealed
under
a
cloth.
With
courtly
adroitness
de
Beausset
half
turned
and
without
turning
his
back
to
the
Emperor
retired
two
steps,
twitching
off
the
cloth
at
the
same
time,
and
said:
"A
present
to
Your
Majesty
from
the
Empress."
It
was
a
portrait,
painted
in
bright
colors
by
Gerard,
of
the
son
borne
to
Napoleon
by
the
daughter
of
the
Emperor
of
Austria,
the
boy
whom
for
some
reason
everyone
called
"The
King
of
Rome."
A
very
pretty
curly-headed
boy
with
a
look
of
the
Christ
in
the
Sistine
Madonna
was
depicted
playing
at
stick
and
ball.
The
ball
represented
the
terrestrial
globe
and
the
stick
in
his
other
hand
a
scepter.
Though
it
was
not
clear
what
the
artist
meant
to
express
by
depicting
the
so-called
King
of
Rome
spiking
the
earth
with
a
stick,
the
allegory
apparently
seemed
to
Napoleon,
as
it
had
done
to
all
who
had
seen
it
in
Paris,
quite
clear
and
very
pleasing.
"The
King
of
Rome!"
he
said,
pointing
to
the
portrait
with
a
graceful
gesture.
"Admirable!"
With
the
natural
capacity
of
an
Italian
for
changing
the
expression
of
his
face
at
will,
he
drew
nearer
to
the
portrait
and
assumed
a
look
of
pensive
tenderness.
He
felt
that
what
he
now
said
and
did
would
be
historical,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
now
be
best
for
him--
whose
grandeur
enabled
his
son
to
play
stick
and
ball
with
the
terrestrial
globe--to
show,
in
contrast
to
that
grandeur,
the
simplest
paternal
tenderness.
His
eyes
grew
dim,
he
moved
forward,
glanced
round
at
a
chair
(which
seemed
to
place
itself
under
him),
and
sat
down
on
it
before
the
portrait.
At
a
single
gesture
from
him
everyone
went
out
on
tiptoe,
leaving
the
great
man
to
himself
and
his
emotion.
Having
sat
still
for
a
while
he
touched--himself
not
knowing
why--the
thick
spot
of
paint
representing
the
highest
light
in
the
portrait,
rose,
and
recalled
de
Beausset
and
the
officer
on
duty.
He
ordered
the
portrait
to
be
carried
outside
his
tent,
that
the
Old
Guard,
stationed
round
it,
might
not
be
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
King
of
Rome,
the
son
and
heir
of
their
adored
monarch.
And
while
he
was
doing
M.
de
Beausset
the
honor
of
breakfasting
with
him,
they
heard,
as
Napoleon
had
anticipated,
the
rapturous
cries
of
the
officers
and
men
of
the
Old
Guard
who
had
run
up
to
see
the
portrait.
"Vive
l'Empereur!
Vive
le
roi
de
Rome!
Vive
l'Empereur!"
came
those
ecstatic
cries.
After
breakfast
Napoleon
in
de
Beausset's
presence
dictated
his
order
of
the
day
to
the
army.
"Short
and
energetic!"
he
remarked
when
he
had
read
over
the
proclamation
which
he
had
dictated
straight
off
without
corrections.
It
ran:
Soldiers!
This
is
the
battle
you
have
so
longed
for.
Victory
depends
on
you.
It
is
essential
for
us;
it
will
give
us
all
we
need:
comfortable
quarters
and
a
speedy
return
to
our
country.
Behave
as
you
did
at
Austerlitz,
Friedland,
Vitebsk,
and
Smolensk.
Let
our
remotest
posterity
recall
your
achievements
this
day
with
pride.
Let
it
be
said
of
each
of
you:
"He
was
in
the
great
battle
before
Moscow!"
"Before
Moscow!"
repeated
Napoleon,
and
inviting
M.
de
Beausset,
who
was
so
fond
of
travel,
to
accompany
him
on
his
ride,
he
went
out
of
the
tent
to
where
the
horses
stood
saddled.
"Your
Majesty
is
too
kind!"
replied
de
Beausset
to
the
invitation
to
accompany
the
Emperor;
he
wanted
to
sleep,
did
not
know
how
to
ride
and
was
afraid
of
doing
so.
But
Napoleon
nodded
to
the
traveler,
and
de
Beausset
had
to
mount.
When
Napoleon
came
out
of
the
tent
the
shouting
of
the
Guards
before
his
son's
portrait
grew
still
louder.
Napoleon
frowned.
"Take
him
away!"
he
said,
pointing
with
a
gracefully
majestic
gesture
to
the
portrait.
"It
is
too
soon
for
him
to
see
a
field
of
battle."
De
Beausset
closed
his
eyes,
bowed
his
head,
and
sighed
deeply,
to
indicate
how
profoundly
he
valued
and
comprehended
the
Emperor's
words.
CHAPTER
XXVII
On
the
twenty-fifth
of
August,
so
his
historians
tell
us,
Napoleon
spent
the
whole
day
on
horseback
inspecting
the
locality,
considering
plans
submitted
to
him
by
his
marshals,
and
personally
giving
commands
to
his
generals.
The
original
line
of
the
Russian
forces
along
the
river
Kolocha
had
been
dislocated
by
the
capture
of
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
on
the
twenty-
fourth,
and
part
of
the
line--the
left
flank--had
been
drawn
back.
That
part
of
the
line
was
not
entrenched
and
in
front
of
it
the
ground
was
more
open
and
level
than
elsewhere.
It
was
evident
to
anyone,
military
or
not,
that
it
was
here
the
French
should
attack.
It
would
seem
that
not
much
consideration
was
needed
to
reach
this
conclusion,
nor
any
particular
care
or
trouble
on
the
part
of
the
Emperor
and
his
marshals,
nor
was
there
any
need
of
that
special
and
supreme
quality
called
genius
that
people
are
so
apt
to
ascribe
to
Napoleon;
yet
the
historians
who
described
the
event
later
and
the
men
who
then
surrounded
Napoleon,
and
he
himself,
thought
otherwise.
Napoleon
rode
over
the
plain
and
surveyed
the
locality
with
a
profound
air
and
in
silence,
nodded
with
approval
or
shook
his
head
dubiously,
and
without
communicating
to
the
generals
around
him
the
profound
course
of
ideas
which
guided
his
decisions
merely
gave
them
his
final
conclusions
in
the
form
of
commands.
Having
listened
to
a
suggestion
from
Davout,
who
was
now
called
Prince
d'Eckmuhl,
to
turn
the
Russian
left
wing,
Napoleon
said
it
should
not
be
done,
without
explaining
why
not.
To
a
proposal
made
by
General
Campan
(who
was
to
attack
the
fleches)
to
lead
his
division
through
the
woods,
Napoleon
agreed,
though
the
so-called
Duke
of
Elchingen
(Ney)
ventured
to
remark
that
a
movement
through
the
woods
was
dangerous
and
might
disorder
the
division.
Having
inspected
the
country
opposite
the
Shevardino
Redoubt,
Napoleon
pondered
a
little
in
silence
and
then
indicated
the
spots
where
two
batteries
should
be
set
up
by
the
morrow
to
act
against
the
Russian
entrenchments,
and
the
places
where,
in
line
with
them,
the
field
artillery
should
be
placed.
After
giving
these
and
other
commands
he
returned
to
his
tent,
and
the
dispositions
for
the
battle
were
written
down
from
his
dictation.
These
dispositions,
of
which
the
French
historians
write
with
enthusiasm
and
other
historians
with
profound
respect,
were
as
follows:
At
dawn
the
two
new
batteries
established
during
the
night
on
the
plain
occupied
by
the
Prince
d'Eckmuhl
will
open
fire
on
the
opposing
batteries
of
the
enemy.
At
the
same
time
the
commander
of
the
artillery
of
the
1st
Corps,
General
Pernetti,
with
thirty
cannon
of
Campan's
division
and
all
the
howitzers
of
Dessaix's
and
Friant's
divisions,
will
move
forward,
open
fire,
and
overwhelm
with
shellfire
the
enemy's
battery,
against
which
will
operate:
24
guns
of
the
artillery
of
the
Guards
30
guns
of
Campan's
division
and
8
guns
of
Friant's
and
Dessaix's
divisions
--
in
all
62
guns.
The
commander
of
the
artillery
of
the
3rd
Corps,
General
Fouche,
will
place
the
howitzers
of
the
3rd
and
8th
Corps,
sixteen
in
all,
on
the
flanks
of
the
battery
that
is
to
bombard
the
entrenchment
on
the
left,
which
will
have
forty
guns
in
all
directed
against
it.
General
Sorbier
must
be
ready
at
the
first
order
to
advance
with
all
the
howitzers
of
the
Guard's
artillery
against
either
one
or
other
of
the
entrenchments.
During
the
cannonade
Prince
Poniatowski
is
to
advance
through
the
wood
on
the
village
and
turn
the
enemy's
position.
General
Campan
will
move
through
the
wood
to
seize
the
first
fortification.
After
the
advance
has
begun
in
this
manner,
orders
will
be
given
in
accordance
with
the
enemy's
movements.
The
cannonade
on
the
left
flank
will
begin
as
soon
as
the
guns
of
the
right
wing
are
heard.
The
sharpshooters
of
Morand's
division
and
of
the
vice-King's
division
will
open
a
heavy
fire
on
seeing
the
attack
commence
on
the
right
wing.
The
vice-King
will
occupy
the
village
and
cross
by
its
three
bridges,
advancing
to
the
same
heights
as
Morand's
and
Gibrard's
divisions,
which
under
his
leadership
will
be
directed
against
the
redoubt
and
come
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
forces.
All
this
must
be
done
in
good
order
(le
tout
se
fera
avec
ordre
et
methode)
as
far
as
possible
retaining
troops
in
reserve.
The
Imperial
Camp
near
Mozhaysk,
September,
6,
1812.
These
dispositions,
which
are
very
obscure
and
confused
if
one
allows
oneself
to
regard
the
arrangements
without
religious
awe
of
his
genius,
related
to
Napoleon's
orders
to
deal
with
four
points--four
different
orders.
Not
one
of
these
was,
or
could
be,
carried
out.
In
the
disposition
it
is
said
first
that
the
batteries
placed
on
the
spot
chosen
by
Napoleon,
with
the
guns
of
Pernetti
and
Fouche;
which
were
to
come
in
line
with
them,
102
guns
in
all,
were
to
open
fire
and
shower
shells
on
the
Russian
fleches
and
redoubts.
This
could
not
be
done,
as
from
the
spots
selected
by
Napoleon
the
projectiles
did
not
carry
to
the
Russian
works,
and
those
102
guns
shot
into
the
air
until
the
nearest
commander,
contrary
to
Napoleon's
instructions,
moved
them
forward.
The
second
order
was
that
Poniatowski,
moving
to
the
village
through
the
wood,
should
turn
the
Russian
left
flank.
This
could
not
be
done
and
was
not
done,
because
Poniatowski,
advancing
on
the
village
through
the
wood,
met
Tuchkov
there
barring
his
way,
and
could
not
and
did
not
turn
the
Russian
position.
The
third
order
was:
General
Campan
will
move
through
the
wood
to
seize
the
first
fortification.
General
Campan's
division
did
not
seize
the
first
fortification
but
was
driven
back,
for
on
emerging
from
the
wood
it
had
to
reform
under
grapeshot,
of
which
Napoleon
was
unaware.
The
fourth
order
was:
The
vice-King
will
occupy
the
village
(Borodino)
and
cross
by
its
three
bridges,
advancing
to
the
same
heights
as
Morand's
and
Gibrard's
divisions
(for
whose
movements
no
directions
are
given),
which
under
his
leadership
will
be
directed
against
the
redoubt
and
come
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
forces.
As
far
as
one
can
make
out,
not
so
much
from
this
unintelligible
sentence
as
from
the
attempts
the
vice-King
made
to
execute
the
orders
given
him,
he
was
to
advance
from
the
left
through
Borodino
to
the
redoubt
while
the
divisions
of
Morand
and
Gerard
were
to
advance
simultaneously
from
the
front.
All
this,
like
the
other
parts
of
the
disposition,
was
not
and
could
not
be
executed.
After
passing
through
Borodino
the
vice-King
was
driven
back
to
the
Kolocha
and
could
get
no
farther;
while
the
divisions
of
Morand
and
Gerard
did
not
take
the
redoubt
but
were
driven
back,
and
the
redoubt
was
only
taken
at
the
end
of
the
battle
by
the
cavalry
(a
thing
probably
unforeseen
and
not
heard
of
by
Napoleon).
So
not
one
of
the
orders
in
the
disposition
was,
or
could
be,
executed.
But
in
the
disposition
it
is
said
that,
after
the
fight
has
commenced
in
this
manner,
orders
will
be
given
in
accordance
with
the
enemy's
movements,
and
so
it
might
be
supposed
that
all
necessary
arrangements
would
be
made
by
Napoleon
during
the
battle.
But
this
was
not
and
could
not
be
done,
for
during
the
whole
battle
Napoleon
was
so
far
away
that,
as
appeared
later,
he
could
not
know
the
course
of
the
battle
and
not
one
of
his
orders
during
the
fight
could
be
executed.
CHAPTER
XXVIII
Many
historians
say
that
the
French
did
not
win
the
battle
of
Borodino
because
Napoleon
had
a
cold,
and
that
if
he
had
not
had
a
cold
the
orders
he
gave
before
and
during
the
battle
would
have
been
still
more
full
of
genius
and
Russia
would
have
been
lost
and
the
face
of
the
world
have
been
changed.
To
historians
who
believe
that
Russia
was
shaped
by
the
will
of
one
man--Peter
the
Great--and
that
France
from
a
republic
became
an
empire
and
French
armies
went
to
Russia
at
the
will
of
one
man--Napoleon--to
say
that
Russia
remained
a
power
because
Napoleon
had
a
bad
cold
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
may
seem
logical
and
convincing.
If
it
had
depended
on
Napoleon's
will
to
fight
or
not
to
fight
the
battle
of
Borodino,
and
if
this
or
that
other
arrangement
depended
on
his
will,
then
evidently
a
cold
affecting
the
manifestation
of
his
will
might
have
saved
Russia,
and
consequently
the
valet
who
omitted
to
bring
Napoleon
his
waterproof
boots
on
the
twenty-fourth
would
have
been
the
savior
of
Russia.
Along
that
line
of
thought
such
a
deduction
is
indubitable,
as
indubitable
as
the
deduction
Voltaire
made
in
jest
(without
knowing
what
he
was
jesting
at)
when
he
saw
that
the
Massacre
of
St.
Bartholomew
was
due
to
Charles
IX's
stomach
being
deranged.
But
to
men
who
do
not
admit
that
Russia
was
formed
by
the
will
of
one
man,
Peter
I,
or
that
the
French
Empire
was
formed
and
the
war
with
Russia
begun
by
the
will
of
one
man,
Napoleon,
that
argument
seems
not
merely
untrue
and
irrational,
but
contrary
to
all
human
reality.
To
the
question
of
what
causes
historic
events
another
answer
presents
itself,
namely,
that
the
course
of
human
events
is
predetermined
from
on
high--
depends
on
the
coincidence
of
the
wills
of
all
who
take
part
in
the
events,
and
that
a
Napoleon's
influence
on
the
course
of
these
events
is
purely
external
and
fictitious.
Strange
as
at
first
glance
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
Massacre
of
St.
Bartholomew
was
not
due
to
Charles
IX's
will,
though
he
gave
the
order
for
it
and
thought
it
was
done
as
a
result
of
that
order;
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
suppose
that
the
slaughter
of
eighty
thousand
men
at
Borodino
was
not
due
to
Napoleon's
will,
though
he
ordered
the
commencement
and
conduct
of
the
battle
and
thought
it
was
done
because
he
ordered
it;
strange
as
these
suppositions
appear,
yet
human
dignity--
which
tells
me
that
each
of
us
is,
if
not
more
at
least
not
less
a
man
than
the
great
Napoleon--demands
the
acceptance
of
that
solution
of
the
question,
and
historic
investigation
abundantly
confirms
it.
At
the
battle
of
Borodino
Napoleon
shot
at
no
one
and
killed
no
one.
That
was
all
done
by
the
soldiers.
Therefore
it
was
not
he
who
killed
people.
The
French
soldiers
went
to
kill
and
be
killed
at
the
battle
of
Borodino
not
because
of
Napoleon's
orders
but
by
their
own
volition.
The
whole
army--French,
Italian,
German,
Polish,
and
Dutch--hungry,
ragged,
and
weary
of
the
campaign,
felt
at
the
sight
of
an
army
blocking
their
road
to
Moscow
that
the
wine
was
drawn
and
must
be
drunk.
Had
Napoleon
then
forbidden
them
to
fight
the
Russians,
they
would
have
killed
him
and
have
proceeded
to
fight
the
Russians
because
it
was
inevitable.
When
they
heard
Napoleon's
proclamation
offering
them,
as
compensation
for
mutilation
and
death,
the
words
of
posterity
about
their
having
been
in
the
battle
before
Moscow,
they
cried
"Vive
l'Empereur!"
just
as
they
had
cried
"Vive
l'Empereur!"
at
the
sight
of
the
portrait
of
the
boy
piercing
the
terrestrial
globe
with
a
toy
stick,
and
just
as
they
would
have
cried
"Vive
l'Empereur!"
at
any
nonsense
that
might
be
told
them.
There
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
cry
"Vive
l'Empereur!"
and
go
to
fight,
in
order
to
get
food
and
rest
as
conquerors
in
Moscow.
So
it
was
not
because
of
Napoleon's
commands
that
they
killed
their
fellow
men.
And
it
was
not
Napoleon
who
directed
the
course
of
the
battle,
for
none
of
his
orders
were
executed
and
during
the
battle
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
before
him.
So
the
way
in
which
these
people
killed
one
another
was
not
decided
by
Napoleon's
will
but
occurred
independently
of
him,
in
accord
with
the
will
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
who
took
part
in
the
common
action.
It
only
seemed
to
Napoleon
that
it
all
took
place
by
his
will.
And
so
the
question
whether
he
had
or
had
not
a
cold
has
no
more
historic
interest
than
the
cold
of
the
least
of
the
transport
soldiers.
Moreover,
the
assertion
made
by
various
writers
that
his
cold
was
the
cause
of
his
dispositions
not
being
as
well-planned
as
on
former
occasions,
and
of
his
orders
during
the
battle
not
being
as
good
as
previously,
is
quite
baseless,
which
again
shows
that
Napoleon's
cold
on
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
was
unimportant.
The
dispositions
cited
above
are
not
at
all
worse,
but
are
even
better,
than
previous
dispositions
by
which
he
had
won
victories.
His
pseudo-
orders
during
the
battle
were
also
no
worse
than
formerly,
but
much
the
same
as
usual.
These
dispositions
and
orders
only
seem
worse
than
previous
ones
because
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
the
first
Napoleon
did
not
win.
The
profoundest
and
most
excellent
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
bad,
and
every
learned
militarist
criticizes
them
with
looks
of
importance,
when
they
relate
to
a
battle
that
has
been
lost,
and
the
very
worst
dispositions
and
orders
seem
very
good,
and
serious
people
fill
whole
volumes
to
demonstrate
their
merits,
when
they
relate
to
a
battle
that
has
been
won.
The
dispositions
drawn
up
by
Weyrother
for
the
battle
of
Austerlitz
were
a
model
of
perfection
for
that
kind
of
composition,
but
still
they
were
criticized--criticized
for
their
very
perfection,
for
their
excessive
minuteness.
Napoleon
at
the
battle
of
Borodino
fulfilled
his
office
as
representative
of
authority
as
well
as,
and
even
better
than,
at
other
battles.
He
did
nothing
harmful
to
the
progress
of
the
battle;
he
inclined
to
the
most
reasonable
opinions,
he
made
no
confusion,
did
not
contradict
himself,
did
not
get
frightened
or
run
away
from
the
field
of
battle,
but
with
his
great
tact
and
military
experience
carried
out
his
role
of
appearing
to
command,
calmly
and
with
dignity.
CHAPTER
XXIX
On
returning
from
a
second
inspection
of
the
lines,
Napoleon
remarked:
"The
chessmen
are
set
up,
the
game
will
begin
tomorrow!"
Having
ordered
punch
and
summoned
de
Beausset,
he
began
to
talk
to
him
about
Paris
and
about
some
changes
he
meant
to
make
in
the
Empress'
household,
surprising
the
prefect
by
his
memory
of
minute
details
relating
to
the
court.
He
showed
an
interest
in
trifles,
joked
about
de
Beausset's
love
of
travel,
and
chatted
carelessly,
as
a
famous,
self-confident
surgeon
who
knows
his
job
does
when
turning
up
his
sleeves
and
putting
on
his
apron
while
a
patient
is
being
strapped
to
the
operating
table.
"The
matter
is
in
my
hands
and
is
clear
and
definite
in
my
head.
When
the
time
comes
to
set
to
work
I
shall
do
it
as
no
one
else
could,
but
now
I
can
jest,
and
the
more
I
jest
and
the
calmer
I
am
the
more
tranquil
and
confident
you
ought
to
be,
and
the
more
amazed
at
my
genius."
Having
finished
his
second
glass
of
punch,
Napoleon
went
to
rest
before
the
serious
business
which,
he
considered,
awaited
him
next
day.
He
was
so
much
interested
in
that
task
that
he
was
unable
to
sleep,
and
in
spite
of
his
cold
which
had
grown
worse
from
the
dampness
of
the
evening,
he
went
into
the
large
division
of
the
tent
at
three
o'clock
in
the
morning,
loudly
blowing
his
nose.
He
asked
whether
the
Russians
had
not
withdrawn,
and
was
told
that
the
enemy's
fires
were
still
in
the
same
places.
He
nodded
approval.
The
adjutant
in
attendance
came
into
the
tent.
"Well,
Rapp,
do
you
think
we
shall
do
good
business
today?"
Napoleon
asked
him.
"Without
doubt,
sire,"
replied
Rapp.
Napoleon
looked
at
him.
"Do
you
remember,
sire,
what
you
did
me
the
honor
to
say
at
Smolensk?"
continued
Rapp.
"The
wine
is
drawn
and
must
be
drunk."
Napoleon
frowned
and
sat
silent
for
a
long
time
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand.
"This
poor
army!"
he
suddenly
remarked.
"It
has
diminished
greatly
since
Smolensk.
Fortune
is
frankly
a
courtesan,
Rapp.
I
have
always
said
so
and
I
am
beginning
to
experience
it.
But
the
Guards,
Rapp,
the
Guards
are
intact?"
he
remarked
interrogatively.
"Yes,
sire,"
replied
Rapp.
Napoleon
took
a
lozenge,
put
it
in
his
mouth,
and
glanced
at
his
watch.
He
was
not
sleepy
and
it
was
still
not
nearly
morning.
It
was
impossible
to
give
further
orders
for
the
sake
of
killing
time,
for
the
orders
had
all
been
given
and
were
now
being
executed.
"Have
the
biscuits
and
rice
been
served
out
to
the
regiments
of
the
Guards?"
asked
Napoleon
sternly.
"Yes,
sire."
"The
rice
too?"
Rapp
replied
that
he
had
given
the
Emperor's
order
about
the
rice,
but
Napoleon
shook
his
head
in
dissatisfaction
as
if
not
believing
that
his
order
had
been
executed.
An
attendant
came
in
with
punch.
Napoleon
ordered
another
glass
to
be
brought
for
Rapp,
and
silently
sipped
his
own.
"I
have
neither
taste
nor
smell,"
he
remarked,
sniffing
at
his
glass.
"This
cold
is
tiresome.
They
talk
about
medicine--what
is
the
good
of
medicine
when
it
can't
cure
a
cold!
Corvisart
gave
me
these
lozenges
but
they
don't
help
at
all.
What
can
doctors
cure?
One
can't
cure
anything.
Our
body
is
a
machine
for
living.
It
is
organized
for
that,
it
is
its
nature.
Let
life
go
on
in
it
unhindered
and
let
it
defend
itself,
it
will
do
more
than
if
you
paralyze
it
by
encumbering
it
with
remedies.
Our
body
is
like
a
perfect
watch
that
should
go
for
a
certain
time;
the
watchmaker
cannot
open
it,
he
can
only
adjust
it
by
fumbling,
and
that
blindfold....
Yes,
our
body
is
just
a
machine
for
living,
that
is
all."
And
having
entered
on
the
path
of
definition,
of
which
he
was
fond,
Napoleon
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
gave
a
new
one.
"Do
you
know,
Rapp,
what
military
art
is?"
asked
he.
"It
is
the
art
of
being
stronger
than
the
enemy
at
a
given
moment.
That's
all."
Rapp
made
no
reply.
"Tomorrow
we
shall
have
to
deal
with
Kutuzov!"
said
Napoleon.
"We
shall
see!
Do
you
remember
at
Braunau
he
commanded
an
army
for
three
weeks
and
did
not
once
mount
a
horse
to
inspect
his
entrenchments....
We
shall
see!"
He
looked
at
his
watch.
It
was
still
only
four
o'clock.
He
did
not
feel
sleepy.
The
punch
was
finished
and
there
was
still
nothing
to
do.
He
rose,
walked
to
and
fro,
put
on
a
warm
overcoat
and
a
hat,
and
went
out
of
the
tent.
The
night
was
dark
and
damp,
a
scarcely
perceptible
moisture
was
descending
from
above.
Near
by,
the
campfires
were
dimly
burning
among
the
French
Guards,
and
in
the
distance
those
of
the
Russian
line
shone
through
the
smoke.
The
weather
was
calm,
and
the
rustle
and
tramp
of
the
French
troops
already
beginning
to
move
to
take
up
their
positions
were
clearly
audible.
Napoleon
walked
about
in
front
of
his
tent,
looked
at
the
fires
and
listened
to
these
sounds,
and
as
he
was
passing
a
tall
guardsman
in
a
shaggy
cap,
who
was
standing
sentinel
before
his
tent
and
had
drawn
himself
up
like
a
black
pillar
at
sight
of
the
Emperor,
Napoleon
stopped
in
front
of
him.
"What
year
did
you
enter
the
service?"
he
asked
with
that
affectation
of
military
bluntness
and
geniality
with
which
he
always
addressed
the
soldiers.
The
man
answered
the
question.
"Ah!
One
of
the
old
ones!
Has
your
regiment
had
its
rice?"
"It
has,
Your
Majesty."
Napoleon
nodded
and
walked
away.
At
half-past
five
Napoleon
rode
to
the
village
of
Shevardino.
It
was
growing
light,
the
sky
was
clearing,
only
a
single
cloud
lay
in
the
east.
The
abandoned
campfires
were
burning
themselves
out
in
the
faint
morning
light.
On
the
right
a
single
deep
report
of
a
cannon
resounded
and
died
away
in
the
prevailing
silence.
Some
minutes
passed.
A
second
and
a
third
report
shook
the
air,
then
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
boomed
solemnly
near
by
on
the
right.
The
first
shots
had
not
yet
ceased
to
reverberate
before
others
rang
out
and
yet
more
were
heard
mingling
with
and
overtaking
one
another.
Napoleon
with
his
suite
rode
up
to
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
where
he
dismounted.
The
game
had
begun.
CHAPTER
XXX
On
returning
to
Gorki
after
having
seen
Prince
Andrew,
Pierre
ordered
his
groom
to
get
the
horses
ready
and
to
call
him
early
in
the
morning,
and
then
immediately
fell
asleep
behind
a
partition
in
a
corner
Boris
had
given
up
to
him.
Before
he
was
thoroughly
awake
next
morning
everybody
had
already
left
the
hut.
The
panes
were
rattling
in
the
little
windows
and
his
groom
was
shaking
him.
"Your
excellency!
Your
excellency!
Your
excellency!"
he
kept
repeating
pertinaciously
while
he
shook
Pierre
by
the
shoulder
without
looking
at
him,
having
apparently
lost
hope
of
getting
him
to
wake
up.
"What?
Has
it
begun?
Is
it
time?"
Pierre
asked,
waking
up.
"Hear
the
firing,"
said
the
groom,
a
discharged
soldier.
"All
the
gentlemen
have
gone
out,
and
his
Serene
Highness
himself
rode
past
long
ago."
Pierre
dressed
hastily
and
ran
out
to
the
porch.
Outside
all
was
bright,
fresh,
dewy,
and
cheerful.
The
sun,
just
bursting
forth
from
behind
a
cloud
that
had
concealed
it,
was
shining,
with
rays
still
half
broken
by
the
clouds,
over
the
roofs
of
the
street
opposite,
on
the
dew-
besprinkled
dust
of
the
road,
on
the
walls
of
the
houses,
on
the
windows,
the
fence,
and
on
Pierre's
horses
standing
before
the
hut.
The
roar
of
guns
sounded
more
distinct
outside.
An
adjutant
accompanied
by
a
Cossack
passed
by
at
a
sharp
trot.
"It's
time,
Count;
it's
time!"
cried
the
adjutant.
Telling
the
groom
to
follow
him
with
the
horses,
Pierre
went
down
the
street
to
the
knoll
from
which
he
had
looked
at
the
field
of
battle
the
day
before.
A
crowd
of
military
men
was
assembled
there,
members
of
the
staff
could
be
heard
conversing
in
French,
and
Kutuzov's
gray
head
in
a
white
cap
with
a
red
band
was
visible,
his
gray
nape
sunk
between
his
shoulders.
He
was
looking
through
a
field
glass
down
the
highroad
before
him.
Mounting
the
steps
to
the
knoll
Pierre
looked
at
the
scene
before
him,
spellbound
by
beauty.
It
was
the
same
panorama
he
had
admired
from
that
spot
the
day
before,
but
now
the
whole
place
was
full
of
troops
and
covered
by
smoke
clouds
from
the
guns,
and
the
slanting
rays
of
the
bright
sun,
rising
slightly
to
the
left
behind
Pierre,
cast
upon
it
through
the
clear
morning
air
penetrating
streaks
of
rosy,
golden-tinted
light
and
long
dark
shadows.
The
forest
at
the
farthest
extremity
of
the
panorama
seemed
carved
in
some
precious
stone
of
a
yellowish-green
color;
its
undulating
outline
was
silhouetted
against
the
horizon
and
was
pierced
beyond
Valuevo
by
the
Smolensk
highroad
crowded
with
troops.
Nearer
at
hand
glittered
golden
cornfields
interspersed
with
copses.
There
were
troops
to
be
seen
everywhere,
in
front
and
to
the
right
and
left.
All
this
was
vivid,
majestic,
and
unexpected;
but
what
impressed
Pierre
most
of
all
was
the
view
of
the
battlefield
itself,
of
Borodino
and
the
hollows
on
both
sides
of
the
Kolocha.
Above
the
Kolocha,
in
Borodino
and
on
both
sides
of
it,
especially
to
the
left
where
the
Voyna
flowing
between
its
marshy
banks
falls
into
the
Kolocha,
a
mist
had
spread
which
seemed
to
melt,
to
dissolve,
and
to
become
translucent
when
the
brilliant
sun
appeared
and
magically
colored
and
outlined
everything.
The
smoke
of
the
guns
mingled
with
this
mist,
and
over
the
whole
expanse
and
through
that
mist
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
were
reflected,
flashing
back
like
lightning
from
the
water,
from
the
dew,
and
from
the
bayonets
of
the
troops
crowded
together
by
the
riverbanks
and
in
Borodino.
A
white
church
could
be
seen
through
the
mist,
and
here
and
there
the
roofs
of
huts
in
Borodino
as
well
as
dense
masses
of
soldiers,
or
green
ammunition
chests
and
ordnance.
And
all
this
moved,
or
seemed
to
move,
as
the
smoke
and
mist
spread
out
over
the
whole
space.
Just
as
in
the
mist-enveloped
hollow
near
Borodino,
so
along
the
entire
line
outside
and
above
it
and
especially
in
the
woods
and
fields
to
the
left,
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
summits
of
the
high
ground,
clouds
of
powder
smoke
seemed
continually
to
spring
up
out
of
nothing,
now
singly,
now
several
at
a
time,
some
translucent,
others
dense,
which,
swelling,
growing,
rolling,
and
blending,
extended
over
the
whole
expanse.
These
puffs
of
smoke
and
(strange
to
say)
the
sound
of
the
firing
produced
the
chief
beauty
of
the
spectacle.
"Puff!"--suddenly
a
round
compact
cloud
of
smoke
was
seen
merging
from
violet
into
gray
and
milky
white,
and
"boom!"
came
the
report
a
second
later.
"Puff!
puff!"--and
two
clouds
arose
pushing
one
another
and
blending
together;
and
"boom,
boom!"
came
the
sounds
confirming
what
the
eye
had
seen.
Pierre
glanced
round
at
the
first
cloud,
which
he
had
seen
as
a
round
compact
ball,
and
in
its
place
already
were
balloons
of
smoke
floating
to
one
side,
and--"puff"
(with
a
pause)--"puff,
puff!"
three
and
then
four
more
appeared
and
then
from
each,
with
the
same
interval--"boom--
boom,
boom!"
came
the
fine,
firm,
precise
sounds
in
reply.
It
seemed
as
if
those
smoke
clouds
sometimes
ran
and
sometimes
stood
still
while
woods,
fields,
and
glittering
bayonets
ran
past
them.
From
the
left,
over
fields
and
bushes,
those
large
balls
of
smoke
were
continually
appearing
followed
by
their
solemn
reports,
while
nearer
still,
in
the
hollows
and
woods,
there
burst
from
the
muskets
small
cloudlets
that
had
no
time
to
become
balls,
but
had
their
little
echoes
in
just
the
same
way.
"Trakh-ta-ta-takh!"
came
the
frequent
crackle
of
musketry,
but
it
was
irregular
and
feeble
in
comparison
with
the
reports
of
the
cannon.
Pierre
wished
to
be
there
with
that
smoke,
those
shining
bayonets,
that
movement,
and
those
sounds.
He
turned
to
look
at
Kutuzov
and
his
suite,
to
compare
his
impressions
with
those
of
others.
They
were
all
looking
at
the
field
of
battle
as
he
was,
and,
as
it
seemed
to
him,
with
the
same
feelings.
All
their
faces
were
now
shining
with
that
latent
warmth
of
feeling
Pierre
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
had
fully
understood
after
his
talk
with
Prince
Andrew.
"Go,
my
dear
fellow,
go...
and
Christ
be
with
you!"
Kutuzov
was
saying
to
a
general
who
stood
beside
him,
not
taking
his
eye
from
the
battlefield.
Having
received
this
order
the
general
passed
by
Pierre
on
his
way
down
the
knoll.
"To
the
crossing!"
said
the
general
coldly
and
sternly
in
reply
to
one
of
the
staff
who
asked
where
he
was
going.
"I'll
go
there
too,
I
too!"
thought
Pierre,
and
followed
the
general.
The
general
mounted
a
horse
a
Cossack
had
brought
him.
Pierre
went
to
his
groom
who
was
holding
his
horses
and,
asking
which
was
the
quietest,
clambered
onto
it,
seized
it
by
the
mane,
and
turning
out
his
toes
pressed
his
heels
against
its
sides
and,
feeling
that
his
spectacles
were
slipping
off
but
unable
to
let
go
of
the
mane
and
reins,
he
galloped
after
the
general,
causing
the
staff
officers
to
smile
as
they
watched
him
from
the
knoll.
CHAPTER
XXXI
Having
descended
the
hill
the
general
after
whom
Pierre
was
galloping
turned
sharply
to
the
left,
and
Pierre,
losing
sight
of
him,
galloped
in
among
some
ranks
of
infantry
marching
ahead
of
him.
He
tried
to
pass
either
in
front
of
them
or
to
the
right
or
left,
but
there
were
soldiers
everywhere,
all
with
the
same
preoccupied
expression
and
busy
with
some
unseen
but
evidently
important
task.
They
all
gazed
with
the
same
dissatisfied
and
inquiring
expression
at
this
stout
man
in
a
white
hat,
who
for
some
unknown
reason
threatened
to
trample
them
under
his
horse's
hoofs.
"Why
ride
into
the
middle
of
the
battalion?"
one
of
them
shouted
at
him.
Another
prodded
his
horse
with
the
butt
end
of
a
musket,
and
Pierre,
bending
over
his
saddlebow
and
hardly
able
to
control
his
shying
horse,
galloped
ahead
of
the
soldiers
where
there
was
a
free
space.
There
was
a
bridge
ahead
of
him,
where
other
soldiers
stood
firing.
Pierre
rode
up
to
them.
Without
being
aware
of
it
he
had
come
to
the
bridge
across
the
Kolocha
between
Gorki
and
Borodino,
which
the
French
(having
occupied
Borodino)
were
attacking
in
the
first
phase
of
the
battle.
Pierre
saw
that
there
was
a
bridge
in
front
of
him
and
that
soldiers
were
doing
something
on
both
sides
of
it
and
in
the
meadow,
among
the
rows
of
new-mown
hay
which
he
had
taken
no
notice
of
amid
the
smoke
of
the
campfires
the
day
before;
but
despite
the
incessant
firing
going
on
there
he
had
no
idea
that
this
was
the
field
of
battle.
He
did
not
notice
the
sound
of
the
bullets
whistling
from
every
side,
or
the
projectiles
that
flew
over
him,
did
not
see
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
of
the
river,
and
for
a
long
time
did
not
notice
the
killed
and
wounded,
though
many
fell
near
him.
He
looked
about
him
with
a
smile
which
did
not
leave
his
face.
"Why's
that
fellow
in
front
of
the
line?"
shouted
somebody
at
him
again.
"To
the
left!...
Keep
to
the
right!"
the
men
shouted
to
him.
Pierre
went
to
the
right,
and
unexpectedly
encountered
one
of
Raevski's
adjutants
whom
he
knew.
The
adjutant
looked
angrily
at
him,
evidently
also
intending
to
shout
at
him,
but
on
recognizing
him
he
nodded.
"How
have
you
got
here?"
he
said,
and
galloped
on.
Pierre,
feeling
out
of
place
there,
having
nothing
to
do,
and
afraid
of
getting
in
someone's
way
again,
galloped
after
the
adjutant.
"What's
happening
here?
May
I
come
with
you?"
he
asked.
"One
moment,
one
moment!"
replied
the
adjutant,
and
riding
up
to
a
stout
colonel
who
was
standing
in
the
meadow,
he
gave
him
some
message
and
then
addressed
Pierre.
"Why
have
you
come
here,
Count?"
he
asked
with
a
smile.
"Still
inquisitive?"
"Yes,
yes,"
assented
Pierre.
But
the
adjutant
turned
his
horse
about
and
rode
on.
"Here
it's
tolerable,"
said
he,
"but
with
Bagration
on
the
left
flank
they're
getting
it
frightfully
hot."
"Really?"
said
Pierre.
"Where
is
that?"
"Come
along
with
me
to
our
knoll.
We
can
get
a
view
from
there
and
in
our
battery
it
is
still
bearable,"
said
the
adjutant.
"Will
you
come?"
"Yes,
I'll
come
with
you,"
replied
Pierre,
looking
round
for
his
groom.
It
was
only
now
that
he
noticed
wounded
men
staggering
along
or
being
carried
on
stretchers.
On
that
very
meadow
he
had
ridden
over
the
day
before,
a
soldier
was
lying
athwart
the
rows
of
scented
hay,
with
his
head
thrown
awkwardly
back
and
his
shako
off.
"Why
haven't
they
carried
him
away?"
Pierre
was
about
to
ask,
but
seeing
the
stern
expression
of
the
adjutant
who
was
also
looking
that
way,
he
checked
himself.
Pierre
did
not
find
his
groom
and
rode
along
the
hollow
with
the
adjutant
to
Raevski's
Redoubt.
His
horse
lagged
behind
the
adjutant's
and
jolted
him
at
every
step.
"You
don't
seem
to
be
used
to
riding,
Count?"
remarked
the
adjutant.
"No
it's
not
that,
but
her
action
seems
so
jerky,"
said
Pierre
in
a
puzzled
tone.
"Why...
she's
wounded!"
said
the
adjutant.
"In
the
off
foreleg
above
the
knee.
A
bullet,
no
doubt.
I
congratulate
you,
Count,
on
your
baptism
of
fire!"
Having
ridden
in
the
smoke
past
the
Sixth
Corps,
behind
the
artillery
which
had
been
moved
forward
and
was
in
action,
deafening
them
with
the
noise
of
firing,
they
came
to
a
small
wood.
There
it
was
cool
and
quiet,
with
a
scent
of
autumn.
Pierre
and
the
adjutant
dismounted
and
walked
up
the
hill
on
foot.
"Is
the
general
here?"
asked
the
adjutant
on
reaching
the
knoll.
"He
was
here
a
minute
ago
but
has
just
gone
that
way,"
someone
told
him,
pointing
to
the
right.
The
adjutant
looked
at
Pierre
as
if
puzzled
what
to
do
with
him
now.
"Don't
trouble
about
me,"
said
Pierre.
"I'll
go
up
onto
the
knoll
if
I
may?"
"Yes,
do.
You'll
see
everything
from
there
and
it's
less
dangerous,
and
I'll
come
for
you."
Pierre
went
to
the
battery
and
the
adjutant
rode
on.
They
did
not
meet
again,
and
only
much
later
did
Pierre
learn
that
he
lost
an
arm
that
day.
The
knoll
to
which
Pierre
ascended
was
that
famous
one
afterwards
known
to
the
Russians
as
the
Knoll
Battery
or
Raevski's
Redoubt,
and
to
the
French
as
la
grande
redoute,
la
fatale
redoute,
la
redoute
du
centre,
around
which
tens
of
thousands
fell,
and
which
the
French
regarded
as
the
key
to
the
whole
position.
This
redoubt
consisted
of
a
knoll,
on
three
sides
of
which
trenches
had
been
dug.
Within
the
entrenchment
stood
ten
guns
that
were
being
fired
through
openings
in
the
earthwork.
In
line
with
the
knoll
on
both
sides
stood
other
guns
which
also
fired
incessantly.
A
little
behind
the
guns
stood
infantry.
When
ascending
that
knoll
Pierre
had
no
notion
that
this
spot,
on
which
small
trenches
had
been
dug
and
from
which
a
few
guns
were
firing,
was
the
most
important
point
of
the
battle.
On
the
contrary,
just
because
he
happened
to
be
there
he
thought
it
one
of
the
least
significant
parts
of
the
field.
Having
reached
the
knoll,
Pierre
sat
down
at
one
end
of
a
trench
surrounding
the
battery
and
gazed
at
what
was
going
on
around
him
with
an
unconsciously
happy
smile.
Occasionally
he
rose
and
walked
about
the
battery
still
with
that
same
smile,
trying
not
to
obstruct
the
soldiers
who
were
loading,
hauling
the
guns,
and
continually
running
past
him
with
bags
and
charges.
The
guns
of
that
battery
were
being
fired
continually
one
after
another
with
a
deafening
roar,
enveloping
the
whole
neighborhood
in
powder
smoke.
In
contrast
with
the
dread
felt
by
the
infantrymen
placed
in
support,
here
in
the
battery
where
a
small
number
of
men
busy
at
their
work
were
separated
from
the
rest
by
a
trench,
everyone
experienced
a
common
and
as
it
were
family
feeling
of
animation.
The
intrusion
of
Pierre's
nonmilitary
figure
in
a
white
hat
made
an
unpleasant
impression
at
first.
The
soldiers
looked
askance
at
him
with
surprise
and
even
alarm
as
they
went
past
him.
The
senior
artillery
officer,
a
tall,
long-legged,
pockmarked
man,
moved
over
to
Pierre
as
if
to
see
the
action
of
the
farthest
gun
and
looked
at
him
with
curiosity.
A
young
round-faced
officer,
quite
a
boy
still
and
evidently
only
just
out
of
the
Cadet
College,
who
was
zealously
commanding
the
two
guns
entrusted
to
him,
addressed
Pierre
sternly.
"Sir,"
he
said,
"permit
me
to
ask
you
to
stand
aside.
You
must
not
be
here."
The
soldiers
shook
their
heads
disapprovingly
as
they
looked
at
Pierre.
But
when
they
had
convinced
themselves
that
this
man
in
the
white
hat
was
doing
no
harm,
but
either
sat
quietly
on
the
slope
of
the
trench
with
a
shy
smile
or,
politely
making
way
for
the
soldiers,
paced
up
and
down
the
battery
under
fire
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
on
a
boulevard,
their
feeling
of
hostile
distrust
gradually
began
to
change
into
a
kindly
and
bantering
sympathy,
such
as
soldiers
feel
for
their
dogs,
cocks,
goats,
and
in
general
for
the
animals
that
live
with
the
regiment.
The
men
soon
accepted
Pierre
into
their
family,
adopted
him,
gave
him
a
nickname
("our
gentleman"),
and
made
kindly
fun
of
him
among
themselves.
A
shell
tore
up
the
earth
two
paces
from
Pierre
and
he
looked
around
with
a
smile
as
he
brushed
from
his
clothes
some
earth
it
had
thrown
up.
"And
how's
it
you're
not
afraid,
sir,
really
now?"
a
red-faced,
broad-
shouldered
soldier
asked
Pierre,
with
a
grin
that
disclosed
a
set
of
sound,
white
teeth.
"Are
you
afraid,
then?"
said
Pierre.
"What
else
do
you
expect?"
answered
the
soldier.
"She
has
no
mercy,
you
know!
When
she
comes
spluttering
down,
out
go
your
innards.
One
can't
help
being
afraid,"
he
said
laughing.
Several
of
the
men,
with
bright
kindly
faces,
stopped
beside
Pierre.
They
seemed
not
to
have
expected
him
to
talk
like
anybody
else,
and
the
discovery
that
he
did
so
delighted
them.
"It's
the
business
of
us
soldiers.
But
in
a
gentleman
it's
wonderful!
There's
a
gentleman
for
you!"
"To
your
places!"
cried
the
young
officer
to
the
men
gathered
round
Pierre.
The
young
officer
was
evidently
exercising
his
duties
for
the
first
or
second
time
and
therefore
treated
both
his
superiors
and
the
men
with
great
precision
and
formality.
The
booming
cannonade
and
the
fusillade
of
musketry
were
growing
more
intense
over
the
whole
field,
especially
to
the
left
where
Bagration's
fleches
were,
but
where
Pierre
was
the
smoke
of
the
firing
made
it
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
anything.
Moreover,
his
whole
attention
was
engrossed
by
watching
the
family
circle--separated
from
all
else--
formed
by
the
men
in
the
battery.
His
first
unconscious
feeling
of
joyful
animation
produced
by
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
battlefield
was
now
replaced
by
another,
especially
since
he
had
seen
that
soldier
lying
alone
in
the
hayfield.
Now,
seated
on
the
slope
of
the
trench,
he
observed
the
faces
of
those
around
him.
By
ten
o'clock
some
twenty
men
had
already
been
carried
away
from
the
battery;
two
guns
were
smashed
and
cannon
balls
fell
more
and
more
frequently
on
the
battery
and
spent
bullets
buzzed
and
whistled
around.
But
the
men
in
the
battery
seemed
not
to
notice
this,
and
merry
voices
and
jokes
were
heard
on
all
sides.
"A
live
one!"
shouted
a
man
as
a
whistling
shell
approached.
"Not
this
way!
To
the
infantry!"
added
another
with
loud
laughter,
seeing
the
shell
fly
past
and
fall
into
the
ranks
of
the
supports.
"Are
you
bowing
to
a
friend,
eh?"
remarked
another,
chaffing
a
peasant
who
ducked
low
as
a
cannon
ball
flew
over.
Several
soldiers
gathered
by
the
wall
of
the
trench,
looking
out
to
see
what
was
happening
in
front.
"They've
withdrawn
the
front
line,
it
has
retired,"
said
they,
pointing
over
the
earthwork.
"Mind
your
own
business,"
an
old
sergeant
shouted
at
them.
"If
they've
retired
it's
because
there's
work
for
them
to
do
farther
back."
And
the
sergeant,
taking
one
of
the
men
by
the
shoulders,
gave
him
a
shove
with
his
knee.
This
was
followed
by
a
burst
of
laughter.
"To
the
fifth
gun,
wheel
it
up!"
came
shouts
from
one
side.
"Now
then,
all
together,
like
bargees!"
rose
the
merry
voices
of
those
who
were
moving
the
gun.
"Oh,
she
nearly
knocked
our
gentleman's
hat
off!"
cried
the
red-faced
humorist,
showing
his
teeth
chaffing
Pierre.
"Awkward
baggage!"
he
added
reproachfully
to
a
cannon
ball
that
struck
a
cannon
wheel
and
a
man's
leg.
"Now
then,
you
foxes!"
said
another,
laughing
at
some
militiamen
who,
stooping
low,
entered
the
battery
to
carry
away
the
wounded
man.
"So
this
gruel
isn't
to
your
taste?
Oh,
you
crows!
You're
scared!"
they
shouted
at
the
militiamen
who
stood
hesitating
before
the
man
whose
leg
had
been
torn
off.
"There,
lads...
oh,
oh!"
they
mimicked
the
peasants,
"they
don't
like
it
at
all!"
Pierre
noticed
that
after
every
ball
that
hit
the
redoubt,
and
after
every
loss,
the
liveliness
increased
more
and
more.
As
the
flames
of
the
fire
hidden
within
come
more
and
more
vividly
and
rapidly
from
an
approaching
thundercloud,
so,
as
if
in
opposition
to
what
was
taking
place,
the
lightning
of
hidden
fire
growing
more
and
more
intense
glowed
in
the
faces
of
these
men.
Pierre
did
not
look
out
at
the
battlefield
and
was
not
concerned
to
know
what
was
happening
there;
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
watching
this
fire
which
burned
ever
more
brightly
and
which
he
felt
was
flaming
up
in
the
same
way
in
his
own
soul.
At
ten
o'clock
the
infantry
that
had
been
among
the
bushes
in
front
of
the
battery
and
along
the
Kamenka
streamlet
retreated.
From
the
battery
they
could
be
seen
running
back
past
it
carrying
their
wounded
on
their
muskets.
A
general
with
his
suite
came
to
the
battery,
and
after
speaking
to
the
colonel
gave
Pierre
an
angry
look
and
went
away
again
having
ordered
the
infantry
supports
behind
the
battery
to
lie
down,
so
as
to
be
less
exposed
to
fire.
After
this
from
amid
the
ranks
of
infantry
to
the
right
of
the
battery
came
the
sound
of
a
drum
and
shouts
of
command,
and
from
the
battery
one
saw
how
those
ranks
of
infantry
moved
forward.
Pierre
looked
over
the
wall
of
the
trench
and
was
particularly
struck
by
a
pale
young
officer
who,
letting
his
sword
hang
down,
was
walking
backwards
and
kept
glancing
uneasily
around.
The
ranks
of
the
infantry
disappeared
amid
the
smoke
but
their
long-
drawn
shout
and
rapid
musketry
firing
could
still
be
heard.
A
few
minutes
later
crowds
of
wounded
men
and
stretcher-bearers
came
back
from
that
direction.
Projectiles
began
to
fall
still
more
frequently
in
the
battery.
Several
men
were
lying
about
who
had
not
been
removed.
Around
the
cannon
the
men
moved
still
more
briskly
and
busily.
No
one
any
longer
took
notice
of
Pierre.
Once
or
twice
he
was
shouted
at
for
being
in
the
way.
The
senior
officer
moved
with
big,
rapid
strides
from
one
gun
to
another
with
a
frowning
face.
The
young
officer,
with
his
face
still
more
flushed,
commanded
the
men
more
scrupulously
than
ever.
The
soldiers
handed
up
the
charges,
turned,
loaded,
and
did
their
business
with
strained
smartness.
They
gave
little
jumps
as
they
walked,
as
though
they
were
on
springs.
The
stormcloud
had
come
upon
them,
and
in
every
face
the
fire
which
Pierre
had
watched
kindle
burned
up
brightly.
Pierre
standing
beside
the
commanding
officer.
The
young
officer,
his
hand
to
his
shako,
ran
up
to
his
superior.
"I
have
the
honor
to
report,
sir,
that
only
eight
rounds
are
left.
Are
we
to
continue
firing?"
he
asked.
"Grapeshot!"
the
senior
shouted,
without
answering
the
question,
looking
over
the
wall
of
the
trench.
Suddenly
something
happened:
the
young
officer
gave
a
gasp
and
bending
double
sat
down
on
the
ground
like
a
bird
shot
on
the
wing.
Everything
became
strange,
confused,
and
misty
in
Pierre's
eyes.
One
cannon
ball
after
another
whistled
by
and
struck
the
earthwork,
a
soldier,
or
a
gun.
Pierre,
who
had
not
noticed
these
sounds
before,
now
heard
nothing
else.
On
the
right
of
the
battery
soldiers
shouting
"Hurrah!"
were
running
not
forwards
but
backwards,
it
seemed
to
Pierre.
A
cannon
ball
struck
the
very
end
of
the
earth
work
by
which
he
was
standing,
crumbling
down
the
earth;
a
black
ball
flashed
before
his
eyes
and
at
the
same
instant
plumped
into
something.
Some
militiamen
who
were
entering
the
battery
ran
back.
"All
with
grapeshot!"
shouted
the
officer.
The
sergeant
ran
up
to
the
officer
and
in
a
frightened
whisper
informed
him
(as
a
butler
at
dinner
informs
his
master
that
there
is
no
more
of
some
wine
asked
for)
that
there
were
no
more
charges.
"The
scoundrels!
What
are
they
doing?"
shouted
the
officer,
turning
to
Pierre.
The
officer's
face
was
red
and
perspiring
and
his
eyes
glittered
under
his
frowning
brow.
"Run
to
the
reserves
and
bring
up
the
ammunition
boxes!"
he
yelled,
angrily
avoiding
Pierre
with
his
eyes
and
speaking
to
his
men.
"I'll
go,"
said
Pierre.
The
officer,
without
answering
him,
strode
across
to
the
opposite
side.
"Don't
fire....
Wait!"
he
shouted.
The
man
who
had
been
ordered
to
go
for
ammunition
stumbled
against
Pierre.
"Eh,
sir,
this
is
no
place
for
you,"
said
he,
and
ran
down
the
slope.
Pierre
ran
after
him,
avoiding
the
spot
where
the
young
officer
was
sitting.
One
cannon
ball,
another,
and
a
third
flew
over
him,
falling
in
front,
beside,
and
behind
him.
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope.
"Where
am
I
going?"
he
suddenly
asked
himself
when
he
was
already
near
the
green
ammunition
wagons.
He
halted
irresolutely,
not
knowing
whether
to
return
or
go
on.
Suddenly
a
terrible
concussion
threw
him
backwards
to
the
ground.
At
the
same
instant
he
was
dazzled
by
a
great
flash
of
flame,
and
immediately
a
deafening
roar,
crackling,
and
whistling
made
his
ears
tingle.
When
he
came
to
himself
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
leaning
on
his
hands;
the
ammunition
wagons
he
had
been
approaching
no
longer
existed,
only
charred
green
boards
and
rags
littered
the
scorched
grass,
and
a
horse,
dangling
fragments
of
its
shaft
behind
it,
galloped
past,
while
another
horse
lay,
like
Pierre,
on
the
ground,
uttering
prolonged
and
piercing
cries.
CHAPTER
XXXII
Beside
himself
with
terror
Pierre
jumped
up
and
ran
back
to
the
battery,
as
to
the
only
refuge
from
the
horrors
that
surrounded
him.
On
entering
the
earthwork
he
noticed
that
there
were
men
doing
something
there
but
that
no
shots
were
being
fired
from
the
battery.
He
had
no
time
to
realize
who
these
men
were.
He
saw
the
senior
officer
lying
on
the
earth
wall
with
his
back
turned
as
if
he
were
examining
something
down
below
and
that
one
of
the
soldiers
he
had
noticed
before
was
struggling
forward
shouting
"Brothers!"
and
trying
to
free
himself
from
some
men
who
were
holding
him
by
the
arm.
He
also
saw
something
else
that
was
strange.
But
he
had
not
time
to
realize
that
the
colonel
had
been
killed,
that
the
soldier
shouting
"Brothers!"
was
a
prisoner,
and
that
another
man
had
been
bayoneted
in
the
back
before
his
eyes,
for
hardly
had
he
run
into
the
redoubt
before
a
thin,
sallow-faced,
perspiring
man
in
a
blue
uniform
rushed
on
him
sword
in
hand,
shouting
something.
Instinctively
guarding
against
the
shock--for
they
had
been
running
together
at
full
speed
before
they
saw
one
another--Pierre
put
out
his
hands
and
seized
the
man
(a
French
officer)
by
the
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
by
the
throat
with
the
other.
The
officer,
dropping
his
sword,
seized
Pierre
by
his
collar.
For
some
seconds
they
gazed
with
frightened
eyes
at
one
another's
unfamiliar
faces
and
both
were
perplexed
at
what
they
had
done
and
what
they
were
to
do
next.
"Am
I
taken
prisoner
or
have
I
taken
him
prisoner?"
each
was
thinking.
But
the
French
officer
was
evidently
more
inclined
to
think
he
had
been
taken
prisoner
because
Pierre's
strong
hand,
impelled
by
instinctive
fear,
squeezed
his
throat
ever
tighter
and
tighter.
The
Frenchman
was
about
to
say
something,
when
just
above
their
heads,
terrible
and
low,
a
cannon
ball
whistled,
and
it
seemed
to
Pierre
that
the
French
officer's
head
had
been
torn
off,
so
swiftly
had
he
ducked
it.
Pierre
too
bent
his
head
and
let
his
hands
fall.
Without
further
thought
as
to
who
had
taken
whom
prisoner,
the
Frenchman
ran
back
to
the
battery
and
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope
stumbling
over
the
dead
and
wounded
who,
it
seemed
to
him,
caught
at
his
feet.
But
before
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
knoll
he
was
met
by
a
dense
crowd
of
Russian
soldiers
who,
stumbling,
tripping
up,
and
shouting,
ran
merrily
and
wildly
toward
the
battery.
(This
was
the
attack
for
which
Ermolov
claimed
the
credit,
declaring
that
only
his
courage
and
good
luck
made
such
a
feat
possible:
it
was
the
attack
in
which
he
was
said
to
have
thrown
some
St.
George's
Crosses
he
had
in
his
pocket
into
the
battery
for
the
first
soldiers
to
take
who
got
there.)
The
French
who
had
occupied
the
battery
fled,
and
our
troops
shouting
"Hurrah!"
pursued
them
so
far
beyond
the
battery
that
it
was
difficult
to
call
them
back.
The
prisoners
were
brought
down
from
the
battery
and
among
them
was
a
wounded
French
general,
whom
the
officers
surrounded.
Crowds
of
wounded-
-some
known
to
Pierre
and
some
unknown--Russians
and
French,
with
faces
distorted
by
suffering,
walked,
crawled,
and
were
carried
on
stretchers
from
the
battery.
Pierre
again
went
up
onto
the
knoll
where
he
had
spent
over
an
hour,
and
of
that
family
circle
which
had
received
him
as
a
member
he
did
not
find
a
single
one.
There
were
many
dead
whom
he
did
not
know,
but
some
he
recognized.
The
young
officer
still
sat
in
the
same
way,
bent
double,
in
a
pool
of
blood
at
the
edge
of
the
earth
wall.
The
red-faced
man
was
still
twitching,
but
they
did
not
carry
him
away.
Pierre
ran
down
the
slope
once
more.
"Now
they
will
stop
it,
now
they
will
be
horrified
at
what
they
have
done!"
he
thought,
aimlessly
going
toward
a
crowd
of
stretcher
bearers
moving
from
the
battlefield.
But
behind
the
veil
of
smoke
the
sun
was
still
high,
and
in
front
and
especially
to
the
left,
near
Semenovsk,
something
seemed
to
be
seething
in
the
smoke,
and
the
roar
of
cannon
and
musketry
did
not
diminish,
but
even
increased
to
desperation
like
a
man
who,
straining
himself,
shrieks
with
all
his
remaining
strength.
CHAPTER
XXXIII
The
chief
action
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
fought
within
the
seven
thousand
feet
between
Borodino
and
Bagration's
fleches.
Beyond
that
space
there
was,
on
the
one
side,
a
demonstration
made
by
the
Russians
with
Uvarov's
cavalry
at
midday,
and
on
the
other
side,
beyond
Utitsa,
Poniatowski's
collision
with
Tuchkov;
but
these
two
were
detached
and
feeble
actions
in
comparison
with
what
took
place
in
the
center
of
the
battlefield.
On
the
field
between
Borodino
and
the
fleches,
beside
the
wood,
the
chief
action
of
the
day
took
place
on
an
open
space
visible
from
both
sides
and
was
fought
in
the
simplest
and
most
artless
way.
The
battle
began
on
both
sides
with
a
cannonade
from
several
hundred
guns.
Then
when
the
whole
field
was
covered
with
smoke,
two
divisions,
Campan's
and
Dessaix's,
advanced
from
the
French
right,
while
Murat's
troops
advanced
on
Borodino
from
their
left.
From
the
Shevardino
Redoubt
where
Napoleon
was
standing
the
fleches
were
two
thirds
of
a
mile
away,
and
it
was
more
than
a
mile
as
the
crow
flies
to
Borodino,
so
that
Napoleon
could
not
see
what
was
happening
there,
especially
as
the
smoke
mingling
with
the
mist
hid
the
whole
locality.
The
soldiers
of
Dessaix's
division
advancing
against
the
fleches
could
only
be
seen
till
they
had
entered
the
hollow
that
lay
between
them
and
the
fleches.
As
soon
as
they
had
descended
into
that
hollow,
the
smoke
of
the
guns
and
musketry
on
the
fleches
grew
so
dense
that
it
covered
the
whole
approach
on
that
side
of
it.
Through
the
smoke
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
something
black--probably
men--and
at
times
the
glint
of
bayonets.
But
whether
they
were
moving
or
stationary,
whether
they
were
French
or
Russian,
could
not
be
discovered
from
the
Shevardino
Redoubt.
The
sun
had
risen
brightly
and
its
slanting
rays
struck
straight
into
Napoleon's
face
as,
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand,
he
looked
at
the
fleches.
The
smoke
spread
out
before
them,
and
at
times
it
looked
as
if
the
smoke
were
moving,
at
times
as
if
the
troops
moved.
Sometimes
shouts
were
heard
through
the
firing,
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
was
being
done
there.
Napoleon,
standing
on
the
knoll,
looked
through
a
field
glass,
and
in
its
small
circlet
saw
smoke
and
men,
sometimes
his
own
and
sometimes
Russians,
but
when
he
looked
again
with
the
naked
eye,
he
could
not
tell
where
what
he
had
seen
was.
He
descended
the
knoll
and
began
walking
up
and
down
before
it.
Occasionally
he
stopped,
listened
to
the
firing,
and
gazed
intently
at
the
battlefield.
But
not
only
was
it
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
happening
from
where
he
was
standing
down
below,
or
from
the
knoll
above
on
which
some
of
his
generals
had
taken
their
stand,
but
even
from
the
fleches
themselves--in
which
by
this
time
there
were
now
Russian
and
now
French
soldiers,
alternately
or
together,
dead,
wounded,
alive,
frightened,
or
maddened--
even
at
those
fleches
themselves
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
taking
place.
There
for
several
hours
amid
incessant
cannon
and
musketry
fire,
now
Russians
were
seen
alone,
now
Frenchmen
alone,
now
infantry,
and
now
cavalry:
they
appeared,
fired,
fell,
collided,
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
one
another,
screamed,
and
ran
back
again.
From
the
battlefield
adjutants
he
had
sent
out,
and
orderlies
from
his
marshals,
kept
galloping
up
to
Napoleon
with
reports
of
the
progress
of
the
action,
but
all
these
reports
were
false,
both
because
it
was
impossible
in
the
heat
of
battle
to
say
what
was
happening
at
any
given
moment
and
because
many
of
the
adjutants
did
not
go
to
the
actual
place
of
conflict
but
reported
what
they
had
heard
from
others;
and
also
because
while
an
adjutant
was
riding
more
than
a
mile
to
Napoleon
circumstances
changed
and
the
news
he
brought
was
already
becoming
false.
Thus
an
adjutant
galloped
up
from
Murat
with
tidings
that
Borodino
had
been
occupied
and
the
bridge
over
the
Kolocha
was
in
the
hands
of
the
French.
The
adjutant
asked
whether
Napoleon
wished
the
troops
to
cross
it?
Napoleon
gave
orders
that
the
troops
should
form
up
on
the
farther
side
and
wait.
But
before
that
order
was
given--almost
as
soon
in
fact
as
the
adjutant
had
left
Borodino--the
bridge
had
been
retaken
by
the
Russians
and
burned,
in
the
very
skirmish
at
which
Pierre
had
been
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle.
An
adjutant
galloped
up
from
the
fleches
with
a
pale
and
frightened
face
and
reported
to
Napoleon
that
their
attack
had
been
repulsed,
Campan
wounded,
and
Davout
killed;
yet
at
the
very
time
the
adjutant
had
been
told
that
the
French
had
been
repulsed,
the
fleches
had
in
fact
been
recaptured
by
other
French
troops,
and
Davout
was
alive
and
only
slightly
bruised.
On
the
basis
of
these
necessarily
untrustworthy
reports
Napoleon
gave
his
orders,
which
had
either
been
executed
before
he
gave
them
or
could
not
be
and
were
not
executed.
The
marshals
and
generals,
who
were
nearer
to
the
field
of
battle
but,
like
Napoleon,
did
not
take
part
in
the
actual
fighting
and
only
occasionally
went
within
musket
range,
made
their
own
arrangements
without
asking
Napoleon
and
issued
orders
where
and
in
what
direction
to
fire
and
where
cavalry
should
gallop
and
infantry
should
run.
But
even
their
orders,
like
Napoleon's,
were
seldom
carried
out,
and
then
but
partially.
For
the
most
part
things
happened
contrary
to
their
orders.
Soldiers
ordered
to
advance
ran
back
on
meeting
grapeshot;
soldiers
ordered
to
remain
where
they
were,
suddenly,
seeing
Russians
unexpectedly
before
them,
sometimes
rushed
back
and
sometimes
forward,
and
the
cavalry
dashed
without
orders
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
Russians.
In
this
way
two
cavalry
regiments
galloped
through
the
Semenovsk
hollow
and
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
incline
turned
round
and
galloped
full
speed
back
again.
The
infantry
moved
in
the
same
way,
sometimes
running
to
quite
other
places
than
those
they
were
ordered
to
go
to.
All
orders
as
to
where
and
when
to
move
the
guns,
when
to
send
infantry
to
shoot
or
horsemen
to
ride
down
the
Russian
infantry--all
such
orders
were
given
by
the
officers
on
the
spot
nearest
to
the
units
concerned,
without
asking
either
Ney,
Davout,
or
Murat,
much
less
Napoleon.
They
did
not
fear
getting
into
trouble
for
not
fulfilling
orders
or
for
acting
on
their
own
initiative,
for
in
battle
what
is
at
stake
is
what
is
dearest
to
man--his
own
life--and
it
sometimes
seems
that
safety
lies
in
running
back,
sometimes
in
running
forward;
and
these
men
who
were
right
in
the
heat
of
the
battle
acted
according
to
the
mood
of
the
moment.
In
reality,
however,
all
these
movements
forward
and
backward
did
not
improve
or
alter
the
position
of
the
troops.
All
their
rushing
and
galloping
at
one
another
did
little
harm,
the
harm
of
disablement
and
death
was
caused
by
the
balls
and
bullets
that
flew
over
the
fields
on
which
these
men
were
floundering
about.
As
soon
as
they
left
the
place
where
the
balls
and
bullets
were
flying
about,
their
superiors,
located
in
the
background,
re-formed
them
and
brought
them
under
discipline
and
under
the
influence
of
that
discipline
led
them
back
to
the
zone
of
fire,
where
under
the
influence
of
fear
of
death
they
lost
their
discipline
and
rushed
about
according
to
the
chance
promptings
of
the
throng.
CHAPTER
XXXIV
Napoleon's
generals--Davout,
Ney,
and
Murat,
who
were
near
that
region
of
fire
and
sometimes
even
entered
it--repeatedly
led
into
it
huge
masses
of
well-ordered
troops.
But
contrary
to
what
had
always
happened
in
their
former
battles,
instead
of
the
news
they
expected
of
the
enemy's
flight,
these
orderly
masses
returned
thence
as
disorganized
and
terrified
mobs.
The
generals
re-formed
them,
but
their
numbers
constantly
decreased.
In
the
middle
of
the
day
Murat
sent
his
adjutant
to
Napoleon
to
demand
reinforcements.
Napoleon
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
knoll,
drinking
punch,
when
Murat's
adjutant
galloped
up
with
an
assurance
that
the
Russians
would
be
routed
if
His
Majesty
would
let
him
have
another
division.
"Reinforcements?"
said
Napoleon
in
a
tone
of
stern
surprise,
looking
at
the
adjutant--a
handsome
lad
with
long
black
curls
arranged
like
Murat's
own--as
though
he
did
not
understand
his
words.
"Reinforcements!"
thought
Napoleon
to
himself.
"How
can
they
need
reinforcements
when
they
already
have
half
the
army
directed
against
a
weak,
unentrenched
Russian
wing?"
"Tell
the
King
of
Naples,"
said
he
sternly,
"that
it
is
not
noon
yet,
and
I
don't
yet
see
my
chessboard
clearly.
Go!..."
The
handsome
boy
adjutant
with
the
long
hair
sighed
deeply
without
removing
his
hand
from
his
hat
and
galloped
back
to
where
men
were
being
slaughtered.
Napoleon
rose
and
having
summoned
Caulaincourt
and
Berthier
began
talking
to
them
about
matters
unconnected
with
the
battle.
In
the
midst
of
this
conversation,
which
was
beginning
to
interest
Napoleon,
Berthier's
eyes
turned
to
look
at
a
general
with
a
suite,
who
was
galloping
toward
the
knoll
on
a
lathering
horse.
It
was
Belliard.
Having
dismounted
he
went
up
to
the
Emperor
with
rapid
strides
and
in
a
loud
voice
began
boldly
demonstrating
the
necessity
of
sending
reinforcements.
He
swore
on
his
honor
that
the
Russians
were
lost
if
the
Emperor
would
give
another
division.
Napoleon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
without
replying.
Belliard
began
talking
loudly
and
eagerly
to
the
generals
of
the
suite
around
him.
"You
are
very
fiery,
Belliard,"
said
Napoleon,
when
he
again
came
up
to
the
general.
"In
the
heat
of
a
battle
it
is
easy
to
make
a
mistake.
Go
and
have
another
look
and
then
come
back
to
me."
Before
Belliard
was
out
of
sight,
a
messenger
from
another
part
of
the
battlefield
galloped
up.
"Now
then,
what
do
you
want?"
asked
Napoleon
in
the
tone
of
a
man
irritated
at
being
continually
disturbed.
"Sire,
the
prince..."
began
the
adjutant.
"Asks
for
reinforcements?"
said
Napoleon
with
an
angry
gesture.
The
adjutant
bent
his
head
affirmatively
and
began
to
report,
but
the
Emperor
turned
from
him,
took
a
couple
of
steps,
stopped,
came
back,
and
called
Berthier.
"We
must
give
reserves,"
he
said,
moving
his
arms
slightly
apart.
"Who
do
you
think
should
be
sent
there?"
he
asked
of
Berthier
(whom
he
subsequently
termed
"that
gosling
I
have
made
an
eagle").
"Send
Claparede's
division,
sire,"
replied
Berthier,
who
knew
all
the
division's
regiments,
and
battalions
by
heart.
Napoleon
nodded
assent.
The
adjutant
galloped
to
Claparede's
division
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
Young
Guards
stationed
behind
the
knoll
moved
forward.
Napoleon
gazed
silently
in
that
direction.
"No!"
he
suddenly
said
to
Berthier.
"I
can't
send
Claparede.
Send
Friant's
division."
Though
there
was
no
advantage
in
sending
Friant's
division
instead
of
Claparede's,
and
even
an
obvious
inconvenience
and
delay
in
stopping
Claparede
and
sending
Friant
now,
the
order
was
carried
out
exactly.
Napoleon
did
not
notice
that
in
regard
to
his
army
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
doctor
who
hinders
by
his
medicines--a
role
he
so
justly
understood
and
condemned.
Friant's
division
disappeared
as
the
others
had
done
into
the
smoke
of
the
battlefield.
From
all
sides
adjutants
continued
to
arrive
at
a
gallop
and
as
if
by
agreement
all
said
the
same
thing.
They
all
asked
for
reinforcements
and
all
said
that
the
Russians
were
holding
their
positions
and
maintaining
a
hellish
fire
under
which
the
French
army
was
melting
away.
Napoleon
sat
on
a
campstool,
wrapped
in
thought.
M.
de
Beausset,
the
man
so
fond
of
travel,
having
fasted
since
morning,
came
up
to
the
Emperor
and
ventured
respectfully
to
suggest
lunch
to
His
Majesty.
"I
hope
I
may
now
congratulate
Your
Majesty
on
a
victory?"
said
he.
Napoleon
silently
shook
his
head
in
negation.
Assuming
the
negation
to
refer
only
to
the
victory
and
not
to
the
lunch,
M.
de
Beausset
ventured
with
respectful
jocularity
to
remark
that
there
is
no
reason
for
not
having
lunch
when
one
can
get
it.
"Go
away..."
exclaimed
Napoleon
suddenly
and
morosely,
and
turned
aside.
A
beatific
smile
of
regret,
repentance,
and
ecstasy
beamed
on
M.
de
Beausset's
face
and
he
glided
away
to
the
other
generals.
Napoleon
was
experiencing
a
feeling
of
depression
like
that
of
an
ever-
lucky
gambler
who,
after
recklessly
flinging
money
about
and
always
winning,
suddenly
just
when
he
has
calculated
all
the
chances
of
the
game,
finds
that
the
more
he
considers
his
play
the
more
surely
he
loses.
His
troops
were
the
same,
his
generals
the
same,
the
same
preparations
had
been
made,
the
same
dispositions,
and
the
same
proclamation
courte
et
energique,
he
himself
was
still
the
same:
he
knew
that
and
knew
that
he
was
now
even
more
experienced
and
skillful
than
before.
Even
the
enemy
was
the
same
as
at
Austerlitz
and
Friedland--yet
the
terrible
stroke
of
his
arm
had
supernaturally
become
impotent.
All
the
old
methods
that
had
been
unfailingly
crowned
with
success:
the
concentration
of
batteries
on
one
point,
an
attack
by
reserves
to
break
the
enemy's
line,
and
a
cavalry
attack
by
"the
men
of
iron,"
all
these
methods
had
already
been
employed,
yet
not
only
was
there
no
victory,
but
from
all
sides
came
the
same
news
of
generals
killed
and
wounded,
of
reinforcements
needed,
of
the
impossibility
of
driving
back
the
Russians,
and
of
disorganization
among
his
own
troops.
Formerly,
after
he
had
given
two
or
three
orders
and
uttered
a
few
phrases,
marshals
and
adjutants
had
come
galloping
up
with
congratulations
and
happy
faces,
announcing
the
trophies
taken,
the
corps
of
prisoners,
bundles
of
enemy
eagles
and
standards,
cannon
and
stores,
and
Murat
had
only
begged
leave
to
loose
the
cavalry
to
gather
in
the
baggage
wagons.
So
it
had
been
at
Lodi,
Marengo,
Arcola,
Jena,
Austerlitz,
Wagram,
and
so
on.
But
now
something
strange
was
happening
to
his
troops.
Despite
news
of
the
capture
of
the
fleches,
Napoleon
saw
that
this
was
not
the
same,
not
at
all
the
same,
as
what
had
happened
in
his
former
battles.
He
saw
that
what
he
was
feeling
was
felt
by
all
the
men
about
him
experienced
in
the
art
of
war.
All
their
faces
looked
dejected,
and
they
all
shunned
one
another's
eyes--only
a
de
Beausset
could
fail
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
what
was
happening.
But
Napoleon
with
his
long
experience
of
war
well
knew
the
meaning
of
a
battle
not
gained
by
the
attacking
side
in
eight
hours,
after
all
efforts
had
been
expended.
He
knew
that
it
was
a
lost
battle
and
that
the
least
accident
might
now--with
the
fight
balanced
on
such
a
strained
center--destroy
him
and
his
army.
When
he
ran
his
mind
over
the
whole
of
this
strange
Russian
campaign
in
which
not
one
battle
had
been
won,
and
in
which
not
a
flag,
or
cannon,
or
army
corps
had
been
captured
in
two
months,
when
he
looked
at
the
concealed
depression
on
the
faces
around
him
and
heard
reports
of
the
Russians
still
holding
their
ground--a
terrible
feeling
like
a
nightmare
took
possession
of
him,
and
all
the
unlucky
accidents
that
might
destroy
him
occurred
to
his
mind.
The
Russians
might
fall
on
his
left
wing,
might
break
through
his
center,
he
himself
might
be
killed
by
a
stray
cannon
ball.
All
this
was
possible.
In
former
battles
he
had
only
considered
the
possibilities
of
success,
but
now
innumerable
unlucky
chances
presented
themselves,
and
he
expected
them
all.
Yes,
it
was
like
a
dream
in
which
a
man
fancies
that
a
ruffian
is
coming
to
attack
him,
and
raises
his
arm
to
strike
that
ruffian
a
terrible
blow
which
he
knows
should
annihilate
him,
but
then
feels
that
his
arm
drops
powerless
and
limp
like
a
rag,
and
the
horror
of
unavoidable
destruction
seizes
him
in
his
helplessness.
The
news
that
the
Russians
were
attacking
the
left
flank
of
the
French
army
aroused
that
horror
in
Napoleon.
He
sat
silently
on
a
campstool
below
the
knoll,
with
head
bowed
and
elbows
on
his
knees.
Berthier
approached
and
suggested
that
they
should
ride
along
the
line
to
ascertain
the
position
of
affairs.
"What?
What
do
you
say?"
asked
Napoleon.
"Yes,
tell
them
to
bring
me
my
horse."
He
mounted
and
rode
toward
Semenovsk.
Amid
the
powder
smoke,
slowly
dispersing
over
the
whole
space
through
which
Napoleon
rode,
horses
and
men
were
lying
in
pools
of
blood,
singly
or
in
heaps.
Neither
Napoleon
nor
any
of
his
generals
had
ever
before
seen
such
horrors
or
so
many
slain
in
such
a
small
area.
The
roar
of
guns,
that
had
not
ceased
for
ten
hours,
wearied
the
ear
and
gave
a
peculiar
significance
to
the
spectacle,
as
music
does
to
tableaux
vivants.
Napoleon
rode
up
the
high
ground
at
Semenovsk,
and
through
the
smoke
saw
ranks
of
men
in
uniforms
of
a
color
unfamiliar
to
him.
They
were
Russians.
The
Russians
stood
in
serried
ranks
behind
Semenovsk
village
and
its
knoll,
and
their
guns
boomed
incessantly
along
their
line
and
sent
forth
clouds
of
smoke.
It
was
no
longer
a
battle:
it
was
a
continuous
slaughter
which
could
be
of
no
avail
either
to
the
French
or
the
Russians.
Napoleon
stopped
his
horse
and
again
fell
into
the
reverie
from
which
Berthier
had
aroused
him.
He
could
not
stop
what
was
going
on
before
him
and
around
him
and
was
supposed
to
be
directed
by
him
and
to
depend
on
him,
and
from
its
lack
of
success
this
affair,
for
the
first
time,
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
and
horrible.
One
of
the
generals
rode
up
to
Napoleon
and
ventured
to
offer
to
lead
the
Old
Guard
into
action.
Ney
and
Berthier,
standing
near
Napoleon,
exchanged
looks
and
smiled
contemptuously
at
this
general's
senseless
offer.
Napoleon
bowed
his
head
and
remained
silent
a
long
time.
"At
eight
hundred
leagues
from
France,
I
will
not
have
my
Guard
destroyed!"
he
said,
and
turning
his
horse
rode
back
to
Shevardino.
CHAPTER
XXXV
On
the
rug-covered
bench
where
Pierre
had
seen
him
in
the
morning
sat
Kutuzov,
his
gray
head
hanging,
his
heavy
body
relaxed.
He
gave
no
orders,
but
only
assented
to
or
dissented
from
what
others
suggested.
"Yes,
yes,
do
that,"
he
replied
to
various
proposals.
"Yes,
yes:
go,
dear
boy,
and
have
a
look,"
he
would
say
to
one
or
another
of
those
about
him;
or,
"No,
don't,
we'd
better
wait!"
He
listened
to
the
reports
that
were
brought
him
and
gave
directions
when
his
subordinates
demanded
that
of
him;
but
when
listening
to
the
reports
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
not
interested
in
the
import
of
the
words
spoken,
but
rather
in
something
else--in
the
expression
of
face
and
tone
of
voice
of
those
who
were
reporting.
By
long
years
of
military
experience
he
knew,
and
with
the
wisdom
of
age
understood,
that
it
is
impossible
for
one
man
to
direct
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
struggling
with
death,
and
he
knew
that
the
result
of
a
battle
is
decided
not
by
the
orders
of
a
commander-in-chief,
nor
the
place
where
the
troops
are
stationed,
nor
by
the
number
of
cannon
or
of
slaughtered
men,
but
by
that
intangible
force
called
the
spirit
of
the
army,
and
he
watched
this
force
and
guided
it
in
as
far
as
that
was
in
his
power.
Kutuzov's
general
expression
was
one
of
concentrated
quiet
attention,
and
his
face
wore
a
strained
look
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
master
the
fatigue
of
his
old
and
feeble
body.
At
eleven
o'clock
they
brought
him
news
that
the
fleches
captured
by
the
French
had
been
retaken,
but
that
Prince
Bagration
was
wounded.
Kutuzov
groaned
and
swayed
his
head.
"Ride
over
to
Prince
Peter
Ivanovich
and
find
out
about
it
exactly,"
he
said
to
one
of
his
adjutants,
and
then
turned
to
the
Duke
of
Wurttemberg
who
was
standing
behind
him.
"Will
Your
Highness
please
take
command
of
the
first
army?"
Soon
after
the
duke's
departure--before
he
could
possibly
have
reached
Semenovsk--his
adjutant
came
back
from
him
and
told
Kutuzov
that
the
duke
asked
for
more
troops.
Kutuzov
made
a
grimace
and
sent
an
order
to
Dokhturov
to
take
over
the
command
of
the
first
army,
and
a
request
to
the
duke--whom
he
said
he
could
not
spare
at
such
an
important
moment--to
return
to
him.
When
they
brought
him
news
that
Murat
had
been
taken
prisoner,
and
the
staff
officers
congratulated
him,
Kutuzov
smiled.
"Wait
a
little,
gentlemen,"
said
he.
"The
battle
is
won,
and
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
capture
of
Murat.
Still,
it
is
better
to
wait
before
we
rejoice."
But
he
sent
an
adjutant
to
take
the
news
round
the
army.
When
Scherbinin
came
galloping
from
the
left
flank
with
news
that
the
French
had
captured
the
fleches
and
the
village
of
Semenovsk,
Kutuzov,
guessing
by
the
sounds
of
the
battle
and
by
Scherbinin's
looks
that
the
news
was
bad,
rose
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
and,
taking
Scherbinin's
arm,
led
him
aside.
"Go,
my
dear
fellow,"
he
said
to
Ermolov,
"and
see
whether
something
can't
be
done."
Kutuzov
was
in
Gorki,
near
the
center
of
the
Russian
position.
The
attack
directed
by
Napoleon
against
our
left
flank
had
been
several
times
repulsed.
In
the
center
the
French
had
not
got
beyond
Borodino,
and
on
their
left
flank
Uvarov's
cavalry
had
put
the
French
to
flight.
Toward
three
o'clock
the
French
attacks
ceased.
On
the
faces
of
all
who
came
from
the
field
of
battle,
and
of
those
who
stood
around
him,
Kutuzov
noticed
an
expression
of
extreme
tension.
He
was
satisfied
with
the
day's
success--a
success
exceeding
his
expectations,
but
the
old
man's
strength
was
failing
him.
Several
times
his
head
dropped
low
as
if
it
were
falling
and
he
dozed
off.
Dinner
was
brought
him.
Adjutant
General
Wolzogen,
the
man
who
when
riding
past
Prince
Andrew
had
said,
"the
war
should
be
extended
widely,"
and
whom
Bagration
so
detested,
rode
up
while
Kutuzov
was
at
dinner.
Wolzogen
had
come
from
Barclay
de
Tolly
to
report
on
the
progress
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank.
The
sagacious
Barclay
de
Tolly,
seeing
crowds
of
wounded
men
running
back
and
the
disordered
rear
of
the
army,
weighed
all
the
circumstances,
concluded
that
the
battle
was
lost,
and
sent
his
favorite
officer
to
the
commander
in
chief
with
that
news.
Kutuzov
was
chewing
a
piece
of
roast
chicken
with
difficulty
and
glanced
at
Wolzogen
with
eyes
that
brightened
under
their
puckering
lids.
Wolzogen,
nonchalantly
stretching
his
legs,
approached
Kutuzov
with
a
half-contemptuous
smile
on
his
lips,
scarcely
touching
the
peak
of
his
cap.
He
treated
his
Serene
Highness
with
a
somewhat
affected
nonchalance
intended
to
show
that,
as
a
highly
trained
military
man,
he
left
it
to
Russians
to
make
an
idol
of
this
useless
old
man,
but
that
he
knew
whom
he
was
dealing
with.
"Der
alte
Herr"
(as
in
their
own
set
the
Germans
called
Kutuzov)
"is
making
himself
very
comfortable,"
thought
Wolzogen,
and
looking
severely
at
the
dishes
in
front
of
Kutuzov
he
began
to
report
to
"the
old
gentleman"
the
position
of
affairs
on
the
left
flank
as
Barclay
had
ordered
him
to
and
as
he
himself
had
seen
and
understood
it.
"All
the
points
of
our
position
are
in
the
enemy's
hands
and
we
cannot
dislodge
them
for
lack
of
troops,
the
men
are
running
away
and
it
is
impossible
to
stop
them,"
he
reported.
Kutuzov
ceased
chewing
and
fixed
an
astonished
gaze
on
Wolzogen,
as
if
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
him.
Wolzogen,
noticing
"the
old
gentleman's"
agitation,
said
with
a
smile:
"I
have
not
considered
it
right
to
conceal
from
your
Serene
Highness
what
I
have
seen.
The
troops
are
in
complete
disorder..."
"You
have
seen?
You
have
seen?..."
Kutuzov
shouted.
Frowning
and
rising
quickly,
he
went
up
to
Wolzogen.
"How...
how
dare
you!..."
he
shouted,
choking
and
making
a
threatening
gesture
with
his
trembling
arms:
"How
dare
you,
sir,
say
that
to
me?
You
know
nothing
about
it.
Tell
General
Barclay
from
me
that
his
information
is
incorrect
and
that
the
real
course
of
the
battle
is
better
known
to
me,
the
commander-in-chief,
than
to
him."
Wolzogen
was
about
to
make
a
rejoinder,
but
Kutuzov
interrupted
him.
"The
enemy
has
been
repulsed
on
the
left
and
defeated
on
the
right
flank.
If
you
have
seen
amiss,
sir,
do
not
allow
yourself
to
say
what
you
don't
know!
Be
so
good
as
to
ride
to
General
Barclay
and
inform
him
of
my
firm
intention
to
attack
the
enemy
tomorrow,"
said
Kutuzov
sternly.
All
were
silent,
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
panting
old
general.
"They
are
repulsed
everywhere,
for
which
I
thank
God
and
our
brave
army!
The
enemy
is
beaten,
and
tomorrow
we
shall
drive
him
from
the
sacred
soil
of
Russia,"
said
Kutuzov
crossing
himself,
and
he
suddenly
sobbed
as
his
eyes
filled
with
tears.
Wolzogen,
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
curling
his
lips,
stepped
silently
aside,
marveling
at
"the
old
gentleman's"
conceited
stupidity.
"Ah,
here
he
is,
my
hero!"
said
Kutuzov
to
a
portly,
handsome,
dark-
haired
general
who
was
just
ascending
the
knoll.
This
was
Raevski,
who
had
spent
the
whole
day
at
the
most
important
part
of
the
field
of
Borodino.
Raevski
reported
that
the
troops
were
firmly
holding
their
ground
and
that
the
French
no
longer
ventured
to
attack.
After
hearing
him,
Kutuzov
said
in
French:
"Then
you
do
not
think,
like
some
others,
that
we
must
retreat?"
"On
the
contrary,
your
Highness,
in
indecisive
actions
it
is
always
the
most
stubborn
who
remain
victors,"
replied
Raevski,
"and
in
my
opinion..."
"Kaysarov!"
Kutuzov
called
to
his
adjutant.
"Sit
down
and
write
out
the
order
of
the
day
for
tomorrow.
And
you,"
he
continued,
addressing
another,
"ride
along
the
line
and
announce
that
tomorrow
we
attack."
While
Kutuzov
was
talking
to
Raevski
and
dictating
the
order
of
the
day,
Wolzogen
returned
from
Barclay
and
said
that
General
Barclay
wished
to
have
written
confirmation
of
the
order
the
field
marshal
had
given.
Kutuzov,
without
looking
at
Wolzogen,
gave
directions
for
the
order
to
be
written
out
which
the
former
commander-in-chief,
to
avoid
personal
responsibility,
very
judiciously
wished
to
receive.
And
by
means
of
that
mysterious
indefinable
bond
which
maintains
throughout
an
army
one
and
the
same
temper,
known
as
"the
spirit
of
the
army,"
and
which
constitutes
the
sinew
of
war,
Kutuzov's
words,
his
order
for
a
battle
next
day,
immediately
became
known
from
one
end
of
the
army
to
the
other.
It
was
far
from
being
the
same
words
or
the
same
order
that
reached
the
farthest
links
of
that
chain.
The
tales
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
at
different
ends
of
the
army
did
not
even
resemble
what
Kutuzov
had
said,
but
the
sense
of
his
words
spread
everywhere
because
what
he
said
was
not
the
outcome
of
cunning
calculations,
but
of
a
feeling
that
lay
in
the
commander-in-chief's
soul
as
in
that
of
every
Russian.
And
on
learning
that
tomorrow
they
were
to
attack
the
enemy,
and
hearing
from
the
highest
quarters
a
confirmation
of
what
they
wanted
to
believe,
the
exhausted,
wavering
men
felt
comforted
and
inspirited.
CHAPTER
XXXVI
Prince
Andrew's
regiment
was
among
the
reserves
which
till
after
one
o'clock
were
stationed
inactive
behind
Semenovsk,
under
heavy
artillery
fire.
Toward
two
o'clock
the
regiment,
having
already
lost
more
than
two
hundred
men,
was
moved
forward
into
a
trampled
oatfield
in
the
gap
between
Semenovsk
and
the
Knoll
Battery,
where
thousands
of
men
perished
that
day
and
on
which
an
intense,
concentrated
fire
from
several
hundred
enemy
guns
was
directed
between
one
and
two
o'clock.
Without
moving
from
that
spot
or
firing
a
single
shot
the
regiment
here
lost
another
third
of
its
men.
From
in
front
and
especially
from
the
right,
in
the
unlifting
smoke
the
guns
boomed,
and
out
of
the
mysterious
domain
of
smoke
that
overlay
the
whole
space
in
front,
quick
hissing
cannon
balls
and
slow
whistling
shells
flew
unceasingly.
At
times,
as
if
to
allow
them
a
respite,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
during
which
the
cannon
balls
and
shells
all
flew
overhead,
but
sometimes
several
men
were
torn
from
the
regiment
in
a
minute
and
the
slain
were
continually
being
dragged
away
and
the
wounded
carried
off.
With
each
fresh
blow
less
and
less
chance
of
life
remained
for
those
not
yet
killed.
The
regiment
stood
in
columns
of
battalion,
three
hundred
paces
apart,
but
nevertheless
the
men
were
always
in
one
and
the
same
mood.
All
alike
were
taciturn
and
morose.
Talk
was
rarely
heard
in
the
ranks,
and
it
ceased
altogether
every
time
the
thud
of
a
successful
shot
and
the
cry
of
"stretchers!"
was
heard.
Most
of
the
time,
by
their
officers'
order,
the
men
sat
on
the
ground.
One,
having
taken
off
his
shako,
carefully
loosened
the
gathers
of
its
lining
and
drew
them
tight
again;
another,
rubbing
some
dry
clay
between
his
palms,
polished
his
bayonet;
another
fingered
the
strap
and
pulled
the
buckle
of
his
bandolier,
while
another
smoothed
and
refolded
his
leg
bands
and
put
his
boots
on
again.
Some
built
little
houses
of
the
tufts
in
the
plowed
ground,
or
plaited
baskets
from
the
straw
in
the
cornfield.
All
seemed
fully
absorbed
in
these
pursuits.
When
men
were
killed
or
wounded,
when
rows
of
stretchers
went
past,
when
some
troops
retreated,
and
when
great
masses
of
the
enemy
came
into
view
through
the
smoke,
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
these
things.
But
when
our
artillery
or
cavalry
advanced
or
some
of
our
infantry
were
seen
to
move
forward,
words
of
approval
were
heard
on
all
sides.
But
the
liveliest
attention
was
attracted
by
occurrences
quite
apart
from,
and
unconnected
with,
the
battle.
It
was
as
if
the
minds
of
these
morally
exhausted
men
found
relief
in
everyday,
commonplace
occurrences.
A
battery
of
artillery
was
passing
in
front
of
the
regiment.
The
horse
of
an
ammunition
cart
put
its
leg
over
a
trace.
"Hey,
look
at
the
trace
horse!...
Get
her
leg
out!
She'll
fall....
Ah,
they
don't
see
it!"
came
identical
shouts
from
the
ranks
all
along
the
regiment.
Another
time,
general
attention
was
attracted
by
a
small
brown
dog,
coming
heaven
knows
whence,
which
trotted
in
a
preoccupied
manner
in
front
of
the
ranks
with
tail
stiffly
erect
till
suddenly
a
shell
fell
close
by,
when
it
yelped,
tucked
its
tail
between
its
legs,
and
darted
aside.
Yells
and
shrieks
of
laughter
rose
from
the
whole
regiment.
But
such
distractions
lasted
only
a
moment,
and
for
eight
hours
the
men
had
been
inactive,
without
food,
in
constant
fear
of
death,
and
their
pale
and
gloomy
faces
grew
ever
paler
and
gloomier.
Prince
Andrew,
pale
and
gloomy
like
everyone
in
the
regiment,
paced
up
and
down
from
the
border
of
one
patch
to
another,
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
beside
an
oatfield,
with
head
bowed
and
arms
behind
his
back.
There
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
and
no
orders
to
be
given.
Everything
went
on
of
itself.
The
killed
were
dragged
from
the
front,
the
wounded
carried
away,
and
the
ranks
closed
up.
If
any
soldiers
ran
to
the
rear
they
returned
immediately
and
hastily.
At
first
Prince
Andrew,
considering
it
his
duty
to
rouse
the
courage
of
the
men
and
to
set
them
an
example,
walked
about
among
the
ranks,
but
he
soon
became
convinced
that
this
was
unnecessary
and
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
teach
them.
All
the
powers
of
his
soul,
as
of
every
soldier
there,
were
unconsciously
bent
on
avoiding
the
contemplation
of
the
horrors
of
their
situation.
He
walked
along
the
meadow,
dragging
his
feet,
rustling
the
grass,
and
gazing
at
the
dust
that
covered
his
boots;
now
he
took
big
strides
trying
to
keep
to
the
footprints
left
on
the
meadow
by
the
mowers,
then
he
counted
his
steps,
calculating
how
often
he
must
walk
from
one
strip
to
another
to
walk
a
mile,
then
he
stripped
the
flowers
from
the
wormwood
that
grew
along
a
boundary
rut,
rubbed
them
in
his
palms,
and
smelled
their
pungent,
sweetly
bitter
scent.
Nothing
remained
of
the
previous
day's
thoughts.
He
thought
of
nothing.
He
listened
with
weary
ears
to
the
ever-recurring
sounds,
distinguishing
the
whistle
of
flying
projectiles
from
the
booming
of
the
reports,
glanced
at
the
tiresomely
familiar
faces
of
the
men
of
the
first
battalion,
and
waited.
"Here
it
comes...
this
one
is
coming
our
way
again!"
he
thought,
listening
to
an
approaching
whistle
in
the
hidden
region
of
smoke.
"One,
another!
Again!
It
has
hit...."
He
stopped
and
looked
at
the
ranks.
"No,
it
has
gone
over.
But
this
one
has
hit!"
And
again
he
started
trying
to
reach
the
boundary
strip
in
sixteen
paces.
A
whizz
and
a
thud!
Five
paces
from
him,
a
cannon
ball
tore
up
the
dry
earth
and
disappeared.
A
chill
ran
down
his
back.
Again
he
glanced
at
the
ranks.
Probably
many
had
been
hit--a
large
crowd
had
gathered
near
the
second
battalion.
"Adjutant!"
he
shouted.
"Order
them
not
to
crowd
together."
The
adjutant,
having
obeyed
this
instruction,
approached
Prince
Andrew.
From
the
other
side
a
battalion
commander
rode
up.
"Look
out!"
came
a
frightened
cry
from
a
soldier
and,
like
a
bird
whirring
in
rapid
flight
and
alighting
on
the
ground,
a
shell
dropped
with
little
noise
within
two
steps
of
Prince
Andrew
and
close
to
the
battalion
commander's
horse.
The
horse
first,
regardless
of
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
show
fear,
snorted,
reared
almost
throwing
the
major,
and
galloped
aside.
The
horse's
terror
infected
the
men.
"Lie
down!"
cried
the
adjutant,
throwing
himself
flat
on
the
ground.
Prince
Andrew
hesitated.
The
smoking
shell
spun
like
a
top
between
him
and
the
prostrate
adjutant,
near
a
wormwood
plant
between
the
field
and
the
meadow.
"Can
this
be
death?"
thought
Prince
Andrew,
looking
with
a
quite
new,
envious
glance
at
the
grass,
the
wormwood,
and
the
streamlet
of
smoke
that
curled
up
from
the
rotating
black
ball.
"I
cannot,
I
do
not
wish
to
die.
I
love
life--I
love
this
grass,
this
earth,
this
air...."
He
thought
this,
and
at
the
same
time
remembered
that
people
were
looking
at
him.
"It's
shameful,
sir!"
he
said
to
the
adjutant.
"What..."
He
did
not
finish
speaking.
At
one
and
the
same
moment
came
the
sound
of
an
explosion,
a
whistle
of
splinters
as
from
a
breaking
window
frame,
a
suffocating
smell
of
powder,
and
Prince
Andrew
started
to
one
side,
raising
his
arm,
and
fell
on
his
chest.
Several
officers
ran
up
to
him.
From
the
right
side
of
his
abdomen,
blood
was
welling
out
making
a
large
stain
on
the
grass.
The
militiamen
with
stretchers
who
were
called
up
stood
behind
the
officers.
Prince
Andrew
lay
on
his
chest
with
his
face
in
the
grass,
breathing
heavily
and
noisily.
"What
are
you
waiting
for?
Come
along!"
The
peasants
went
up
and
took
him
by
his
shoulders
and
legs,
but
he
moaned
piteously
and,
exchanging
looks,
they
set
him
down
again.
"Pick
him
up,
lift
him,
it's
all
the
same!"
cried
someone.
They
again
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
laid
him
on
the
stretcher.
"Ah,
God!
My
God!
What
is
it?
The
stomach?
That
means
death!
My
God!"--
voices
among
the
officers
were
heard
saying.
"It
flew
a
hair's
breadth
past
my
ear,"
said
the
adjutant.
The
peasants,
adjusting
the
stretcher
to
their
shoulders,
started
hurriedly
along
the
path
they
had
trodden
down,
to
the
dressing
station.
"Keep
in
step!
Ah...
those
peasants!"
shouted
an
officer,
seizing
by
their
shoulders
and
checking
the
peasants,
who
were
walking
unevenly
and
jolting
the
stretcher.
"Get
into
step,
Fedor...
I
say,
Fedor!"
said
the
foremost
peasant.
"Now
that's
right!"
said
the
one
behind
joyfully,
when
he
had
got
into
step.
"Your
excellency!
Eh,
Prince!"
said
the
trembling
voice
of
Timokhin,
who
had
run
up
and
was
looking
down
on
the
stretcher.
Prince
Andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
at
the
speaker
from
the
stretcher
into
which
his
head
had
sunk
deep
and
again
his
eyelids
drooped.
The
militiamen
carried
Prince
Andrew
to
the
dressing
station
by
the
wood,
where
wagons
were
stationed.
The
dressing
station
consisted
of
three
tents
with
flaps
turned
back,
pitched
at
the
edge
of
a
birch
wood.
In
the
wood,
wagons
and
horses
were
standing.
The
horses
were
eating
oats
from
their
movable
troughs
and
sparrows
flew
down
and
pecked
the
grains
that
fell.
Some
crows,
scenting
blood,
flew
among
the
birch
trees
cawing
impatiently.
Around
the
tents,
over
more
than
five
acres,
bloodstained
men
in
various
garbs
stood,
sat,
or
lay.
Around
the
wounded
stood
crowds
of
soldier
stretcher-bearers
with
dismal
and
attentive
faces,
whom
the
officers
keeping
order
tried
in
vain
to
drive
from
the
spot.
Disregarding
the
officers'
orders,
the
soldiers
stood
leaning
against
their
stretchers
and
gazing
intently,
as
if
trying
to
comprehend
the
difficult
problem
of
what
was
taking
place
before
them.
From
the
tents
came
now
loud
angry
cries
and
now
plaintive
groans.
Occasionally
dressers
ran
out
to
fetch
water,
or
to
point
out
those
who
were
to
be
brought
in
next.
The
wounded
men
awaiting
their
turn
outside
the
tents
groaned,
sighed,
wept,
screamed,
swore,
or
asked
for
vodka.
Some
were
delirious.
Prince
Andrew's
bearers,
stepping
over
the
wounded
who
had
not
yet
been
bandaged,
took
him,
as
a
regimental
commander,
close
up
to
one
of
the
tents
and
there
stopped,
awaiting
instructions.
Prince
Andrew
opened
his
eyes
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
on
around
him.
He
remembered
the
meadow,
the
wormwood,
the
field,
the
whirling
black
ball,
and
his
sudden
rush
of
passionate
love
of
life.
Two
steps
from
him,
leaning
against
a
branch
and
talking
loudly
and
attracting
general
attention,
stood
a
tall,
handsome,
black-haired
noncommissioned
officer
with
a
bandaged
head.
He
had
been
wounded
in
the
head
and
leg
by
bullets.
Around
him,
eagerly
listening
to
his
talk,
a
crowd
of
wounded
and
stretcher-bearers
was
gathered.
"We
kicked
him
out
from
there
so
that
he
chucked
everything,
we
grabbed
the
King
himself!"
cried
he,
looking
around
him
with
eyes
that
glittered
with
fever.
"If
only
reserves
had
come
up
just
then,
lads,
there
wouldn't
have
been
nothing
left
of
him!
I
tell
you
surely..."
Like
all
the
others
near
the
speaker,
Prince
Andrew
looked
at
him
with
shining
eyes
and
experienced
a
sense
of
comfort.
"But
isn't
it
all
the
same
now?"
thought
he.
"And
what
will
be
there,
and
what
has
there
been
here?
Why
was
I
so
reluctant
to
part
with
life?
There
was
something
in
this
life
I
did
not
and
do
not
understand."
CHAPTER
XXXVII
One
of
the
doctors
came
out
of
the
tent
in
a
bloodstained
apron,
holding
a
cigar
between
the
thumb
and
little
finger
of
one
of
his
small
bloodstained
hands,
so
as
not
to
smear
it.
He
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
him,
but
above
the
level
of
the
wounded
men.
He
evidently
wanted
a
little
respite.
After
turning
his
head
from
right
to
left
for
some
time,
he
sighed
and
looked
down.
"All
right,
immediately,"
he
replied
to
a
dresser
who
pointed
Prince
Andrew
out
to
him,
and
he
told
them
to
carry
him
into
the
tent.
Murmurs
arose
among
the
wounded
who
were
waiting.
"It
seems
that
even
in
the
next
world
only
the
gentry
are
to
have
a
chance!"
remarked
one.
Prince
Andrew
was
carried
in
and
laid
on
a
table
that
had
only
just
been
cleared
and
which
a
dresser
was
washing
down.
Prince
Andrew
could
not
make
out
distinctly
what
was
in
that
tent.
The
pitiful
groans
from
all
sides
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
thigh,
stomach,
and
back
distracted
him.
All
he
saw
about
him
merged
into
a
general
impression
of
naked,
bleeding
human
bodies
that
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
of
the
low
tent,
as
a
few
weeks
previously,
on
that
hot
August
day,
such
bodies
had
filled
the
dirty
pond
beside
the
Smolensk
road.
Yes,
it
was
the
same
flesh,
the
same
chair
a
canon,
the
sight
of
which
had
even
then
filled
him
with
horror,
as
by
a
presentiment.
There
were
three
operating
tables
in
the
tent.
Two
were
occupied,
and
on
the
third
they
placed
Prince
Andrew.
For
a
little
while
he
was
left
alone
and
involuntarily
witnessed
what
was
taking
place
on
the
other
two
tables.
On
the
nearest
one
sat
a
Tartar,
probably
a
Cossack,
judging
by
the
uniform
thrown
down
beside
him.
Four
soldiers
were
holding
him,
and
a
spectacled
doctor
was
cutting
into
his
muscular
brown
back.
"Ooh,
ooh,
ooh!"
grunted
the
Tartar,
and
suddenly
lifting
up
his
swarthy
snub-nosed
face
with
its
high
cheekbones,
and
baring
his
white
teeth,
he
began
to
wriggle
and
twitch
his
body
and
utter
piercing,
ringing,
and
prolonged
yells.
On
the
other
table,
round
which
many
people
were
crowding,
a
tall
well-fed
man
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
thrown
back.
His
curly
hair,
its
color,
and
the
shape
of
his
head
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew.
Several
dressers
were
pressing
on
his
chest
to
hold
him
down.
One
large,
white,
plump
leg
twitched
rapidly
all
the
time
with
a
feverish
tremor.
The
man
was
sobbing
and
choking
convulsively.
Two
doctors--one
of
whom
was
pale
and
trembling--were
silently
doing
something
to
this
man's
other,
gory
leg.
When
he
had
finished
with
the
Tartar,
whom
they
covered
with
an
overcoat,
the
spectacled
doctor
came
up
to
Prince
Andrew,
wiping
his
hands.
He
glanced
at
Prince
Andrew's
face
and
quickly
turned
away.
"Undress
him!
What
are
you
waiting
for?"
he
cried
angrily
to
the
dressers.
His
very
first,
remotest
recollections
of
childhood
came
back
to
Prince
Andrew's
mind
when
the
dresser
with
sleeves
rolled
up
began
hastily
to
undo
the
buttons
of
his
clothes
and
undressed
him.
The
doctor
bent
down
over
the
wound,
felt
it,
and
sighed
deeply.
Then
he
made
a
sign
to
someone,
and
the
torturing
pain
in
his
abdomen
caused
Prince
Andrew
to
lose
consciousness.
When
he
came
to
himself
the
splintered
portions
of
his
thighbone
had
been
extracted,
the
torn
flesh
cut
away,
and
the
wound
bandaged.
Water
was
being
sprinkled
on
his
face.
As
soon
as
Prince
Andrew
opened
his
eyes,
the
doctor
bent
over,
kissed
him
silently
on
the
lips,
and
hurried
away.
After
the
sufferings
he
had
been
enduring,
Prince
Andrew
enjoyed
a
blissful
feeling
such
as
he
had
not
experienced
for
a
long
time.
All
the
best
and
happiest
moments
of
his
life--especially
his
earliest
childhood,
when
he
used
to
be
undressed
and
put
to
bed,
and
when
leaning
over
him
his
nurse
sang
him
to
sleep
and
he,
burying
his
head
in
the
pillow,
felt
happy
in
the
mere
consciousness
of
life--returned
to
his
memory,
not
merely
as
something
past
but
as
something
present.
The
doctors
were
busily
engaged
with
the
wounded
man
the
shape
of
whose
head
seemed
familiar
to
Prince
Andrew:
they
were
lifting
him
up
and
trying
to
quiet
him.
"Show
it
to
me....
Oh,
ooh...
Oh!
Oh,
ooh!"
his
frightened
moans
could
be
heard,
subdued
by
suffering
and
broken
by
sobs.
Hearing
those
moans
Prince
Andrew
wanted
to
weep.
Whether
because
he
was
dying
without
glory,
or
because
he
was
sorry
to
part
with
life,
or
because
of
those
memories
of
a
childhood
that
could
not
return,
or
because
he
was
suffering
and
others
were
suffering
and
that
man
near
him
was
groaning
so
piteously--he
felt
like
weeping
childlike,
kindly,
and
almost
happy
tears.
The
wounded
man
was
shown
his
amputated
leg
stained
with
clotted
blood
and
with
the
boot
still
on.
"Oh!
Oh,
ooh!"
he
sobbed,
like
a
woman.
The
doctor
who
had
been
standing
beside
him,
preventing
Prince
Andrew
from
seeing
his
face,
moved
away.
"My
God!
What
is
this?
Why
is
he
here?"
said
Prince
Andrew
to
himself.
In
the
miserable,
sobbing,
enfeebled
man
whose
leg
had
just
been
amputated,
he
recognized
Anatole
Kuragin.
Men
were
supporting
him
in
their
arms
and
offering
him
a
glass
of
water,
but
his
trembling,
swollen
lips
could
not
grasp
its
rim.
Anatole
was
sobbing
painfully.
"Yes,
it
is
he!
Yes,
that
man
is
somehow
closely
and
painfully
connected
with
me,"
thought
Prince
Andrew,
not
yet
clearly
grasping
what
he
saw
before
him.
"What
is
the
connection
of
that
man
with
my
childhood
and
life?"
he
asked
himself
without
finding
an
answer.
And
suddenly
a
new
unexpected
memory
from
that
realm
of
pure
and
loving
childhood
presented
itself
to
him.
He
remembered
Natasha
as
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
at
the
ball
in
1810,
with
her
slender
neck
and
arms
and
with
a
frightened
happy
face
ready
for
rapture,
and
love
and
tenderness
for
her,
stronger
and
more
vivid
than
ever,
awoke
in
his
soul.
He
now
remembered
the
connection
that
existed
between
himself
and
this
man
who
was
dimly
gazing
at
him
through
tears
that
filled
his
swollen
eyes.
He
remembered
everything,
and
ecstatic
pity
and
love
for
that
man
overflowed
his
happy
heart.
Prince
Andrew
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
and
wept
tender
loving
tears
for
his
fellow
men,
for
himself,
and
for
his
own
and
their
errors.
"Compassion,
love
of
our
brothers,
for
those
who
love
us
and
for
those
who
hate
us,
love
of
our
enemies;
yes,
that
love
which
God
preached
on
earth
and
which
Princess
Mary
taught
me
and
I
did
not
understand--that
is
what
made
me
sorry
to
part
with
life,
that
is
what
remained
for
me
had
I
lived.
But
now
it
is
too
late.
I
know
it!"
CHAPTER
XXXVIII
The
terrible
spectacle
of
the
battlefield
covered
with
dead
and
wounded,
together
with
the
heaviness
of
his
head
and
the
news
that
some
twenty
generals
he
knew
personally
had
been
killed
or
wounded,
and
the
consciousness
of
the
impotence
of
his
once
mighty
arm,
produced
an
unexpected
impression
on
Napoleon
who
usually
liked
to
look
at
the
killed
and
wounded,
thereby,
he
considered,
testing
his
strength
of
mind.
This
day
the
horrible
appearance
of
the
battlefield
overcame
that
strength
of
mind
which
he
thought
constituted
his
merit
and
his
greatness.
He
rode
hurriedly
from
the
battlefield
and
returned
to
the
Shevardino
knoll,
where
he
sat
on
his
campstool,
his
sallow
face
swollen
and
heavy,
his
eyes
dim,
his
nose
red,
and
his
voice
hoarse,
involuntarily
listening,
with
downcast
eyes,
to
the
sounds
of
firing.
With
painful
dejection
he
awaited
the
end
of
this
action,
in
which
he
regarded
himself
as
a
participant
and
which
he
was
unable
to
arrest.
A
personal,
human
feeling
for
a
brief
moment
got
the
better
of
the
artificial
phantasm
of
life
he
had
served
so
long.
He
felt
in
his
own
person
the
sufferings
and
death
he
had
witnessed
on
the
battlefield.
The
heaviness
of
his
head
and
chest
reminded
him
of
the
possibility
of
suffering
and
death
for
himself.
At
that
moment
he
did
not
desire
Moscow,
or
victory,
or
glory
(what
need
had
he
for
any
more
glory?).
The
one
thing
he
wished
for
was
rest,
tranquillity,
and
freedom.
But
when
he
had
been
on
the
Semenovsk
heights
the
artillery
commander
had
proposed
to
him
to
bring
several
batteries
of
artillery
up
to
those
heights
to
strengthen
the
fire
on
the
Russian
troops
crowded
in
front
of
Knyazkovo.
Napoleon
had
assented
and
had
given
orders
that
news
should
be
brought
to
him
of
the
effect
those
batteries
produced.
An
adjutant
came
now
to
inform
him
that
the
fire
of
two
hundred
guns
had
been
concentrated
on
the
Russians,
as
he
had
ordered,
but
that
they
still
held
their
ground.
"Our
fire
is
mowing
them
down
by
rows,
but
still
they
hold
on,"
said
the
adjutant.
"They
want
more!..."
said
Napoleon
in
a
hoarse
voice.
"Sire?"
asked
the
adjutant
who
had
not
heard
the
remark.
"They
want
more!"
croaked
Napoleon
frowning.
"Let
them
have
it!"
Even
before
he
gave
that
order
the
thing
he
did
not
desire,
and
for
which
he
gave
the
order
only
because
he
thought
it
was
expected
of
him,
was
being
done.
And
he
fell
back
into
that
artificial
realm
of
imaginary
greatness,
and
again--as
a
horse
walking
a
treadmill
thinks
it
is
doing
something
for
itself--he
submissively
fulfilled
the
cruel,
sad,
gloomy,
and
inhuman
role
predestined
for
him.
And
not
for
that
day
and
hour
alone
were
the
mind
and
conscience
darkened
of
this
man
on
whom
the
responsibility
for
what
was
happening
lay
more
than
on
all
the
others
who
took
part
in
it.
Never
to
the
end
of
his
life
could
he
understand
goodness,
beauty,
or
truth,
or
the
significance
of
his
actions
which
were
too
contrary
to
goodness
and
truth,
too
remote
from
everything
human,
for
him
ever
to
be
able
to
grasp
their
meaning.
He
could
not
disavow
his
actions,
belauded
as
they
were
by
half
the
world,
and
so
he
had
to
repudiate
truth,
goodness,
and
all
humanity.
Not
only
on
that
day,
as
he
rode
over
the
battlefield
strewn
with
men
killed
and
maimed
(by
his
will
as
he
believed),
did
he
reckon
as
he
looked
at
them
how
many
Russians
there
were
for
each
Frenchman
and,
deceiving
himself,
find
reason
for
rejoicing
in
the
calculation
that
there
were
five
Russians
for
every
Frenchman.
Not
on
that
day
alone
did
he
write
in
a
letter
to
Paris
that
"the
battle
field
was
superb,"
because
fifty
thousand
corpses
lay
there,
but
even
on
the
island
of
St.
Helena
in
the
peaceful
solitude
where
he
said
he
intended
to
devote
his
leisure
to
an
account
of
the
great
deeds
he
had
done,
he
wrote:
The
Russian
war
should
have
been
the
most
popular
war
of
modern
times:
it
was
a
war
of
good
sense,
for
real
interests,
for
the
tranquillity
and
security
of
all;
it
was
purely
pacific
and
conservative.
It
was
a
war
for
a
great
cause,
the
end
of
uncertainties
and
the
beginning
of
security.
A
new
horizon
and
new
labors
were
opening
out,
full
of
well-being
and
prosperity
for
all.
The
European
system
was
already
founded;
all
that
remained
was
to
organize
it.
Satisfied
on
these
great
points
and
with
tranquility
everywhere,
I
too
should
have
had
my
Congress
and
my
Holy
Alliance.
Those
ideas
were
stolen
from
me.
In
that
reunion
of
great
sovereigns
we
should
have
discussed
our
interests
like
one
family,
and
have
rendered
account
to
the
peoples
as
clerk
to
master.
Europe
would
in
this
way
soon
have
been,
in
fact,
but
one
people,
and
anyone
who
traveled
anywhere
would
have
found
himself
always
in
the
common
fatherland.
I
should
have
demanded
the
freedom
of
all
navigable
rivers
for
everybody,
that
the
seas
should
be
common
to
all,
and
that
the
great
standing
armies
should
be
reduced
henceforth
to
mere
guards
for
the
sovereigns.
On
returning
to
France,
to
the
bosom
of
the
great,
strong,
magnificent,
peaceful,
and
glorious
fatherland,
I
should
have
proclaimed
her
frontiers
immutable;
all
future
wars
purely
defensive,
all
aggrandizement
antinational.
I
should
have
associated
my
son
in
the
Empire;
my
dictatorship
would
have
been
finished,
and
his
constitutional
reign
would
have
begun.
Paris
would
have
been
the
capital
of
the
world,
and
the
French
the
envy
of
the
nations!
My
leisure
then,
and
my
old
age,
would
have
been
devoted,
in
company
with
the
Empress
and
during
the
royal
apprenticeship
of
my
son,
to
leisurely
visiting,
with
our
own
horses
and
like
a
true
country
couple,
every
corner
of
the
Empire,
receiving
complaints,
redressing
wrongs,
and
scattering
public
buildings
and
benefactions
on
all
sides
and
everywhere.
Napoleon,
predestined
by
Providence
for
the
gloomy
role
of
executioner
of
the
peoples,
assured
himself
that
the
aim
of
his
actions
had
been
the
peoples'
welfare
and
that
he
could
control
the
fate
of
millions
and
by
the
employment
of
power
confer
benefactions.
"Of
four
hundred
thousand
who
crossed
the
Vistula,"
he
wrote
further
of
the
Russian
war,
"half
were
Austrians,
Prussians,
Saxons,
Poles,
Bavarians,
Wurttembergers,
Mecklenburgers,
Spaniards,
Italians,
and
Neapolitans.
The
Imperial
army,
strictly
speaking,
was
one
third
composed
of
Dutch,
Belgians,
men
from
the
borders
of
the
Rhine,
Piedmontese,
Swiss,
Genevese,
Tuscans,
Romans,
inhabitants
of
the
Thirty-second
Military
Division,
of
Bremen,
of
Hamburg,
and
so
on:
it
included
scarcely
a
hundred
and
forty
thousand
who
spoke
French.
The
Russian
expedition
actually
cost
France
less
than
fifty
thousand
men;
the
Russian
army
in
its
retreat
from
Vilna
to
Moscow
lost
in
the
various
battles
four
times
more
men
than
the
French
army;
the
burning
of
Moscow
cost
the
lives
of
a
hundred
thousand
Russians
who
died
of
cold
and
want
in
the
woods;
finally,
in
its
march
from
Moscow
to
the
Oder
the
Russian
army
also
suffered
from
the
severity
of
the
season;
so
that
by
the
time
it
reached
Vilna
it
numbered
only
fifty
thousand,
and
at
Kalisch
less
than
eighteen
thousand."
He
imagined
that
the
war
with
Russia
came
about
by
his
will,
and
the
horrors
that
occurred
did
not
stagger
his
soul.
He
boldly
took
the
whole
responsibility
for
what
happened,
and
his
darkened
mind
found
justification
in
the
belief
that
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
perished
there
were
fewer
Frenchmen
than
Hessians
and
Bavarians.
CHAPTER
XXXIX
Several
tens
of
thousands
of
the
slain
lay
in
diverse
postures
and
various
uniforms
on
the
fields
and
meadows
belonging
to
the
Davydov
family
and
to
the
crown
serfs--those
fields
and
meadows
where
for
hundreds
of
years
the
peasants
of
Borodino,
Gorki,
Shevardino,
and
Semenovsk
had
reaped
their
harvests
and
pastured
their
cattle.
At
the
dressing
stations
the
grass
and
earth
were
soaked
with
blood
for
a
space
of
some
three
acres
around.
Crowds
of
men
of
various
arms,
wounded
and
unwounded,
with
frightened
faces,
dragged
themselves
back
to
Mozhaysk
from
the
one
army
and
back
to
Valuevo
from
the
other.
Other
crowds,
exhausted
and
hungry,
went
forward
led
by
their
officers.
Others
held
their
ground
and
continued
to
fire.
Over
the
whole
field,
previously
so
gaily
beautiful
with
the
glitter
of
bayonets
and
cloudlets
of
smoke
in
the
morning
sun,
there
now
spread
a
mist
of
damp
and
smoke
and
a
strange
acid
smell
of
saltpeter
and
blood.
Clouds
gathered
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
on
the
dead
and
wounded,
on
the
frightened,
exhausted,
and
hesitating
men,
as
if
to
say:
"Enough,
men!
Enough!
Cease...
bethink
yourselves!
What
are
you
doing?"
To
the
men
of
both
sides
alike,
worn
out
by
want
of
food
and
rest,
it
began
equally
to
appear
doubtful
whether
they
should
continue
to
slaughter
one
another;
all
the
faces
expressed
hesitation,
and
the
question
arose
in
every
soul:
"For
what,
for
whom,
must
I
kill
and
be
killed?...
You
may
go
and
kill
whom
you
please,
but
I
don't
want
to
do
so
anymore!"
By
evening
this
thought
had
ripened
in
every
soul.
At
any
moment
these
men
might
have
been
seized
with
horror
at
what
they
were
doing
and
might
have
thrown
up
everything
and
run
away
anywhere.
But
though
toward
the
end
of
the
battle
the
men
felt
all
the
horror
of
what
they
were
doing,
though
they
would
have
been
glad
to
leave
off,
some
incomprehensible,
mysterious
power
continued
to
control
them,
and
they
still
brought
up
the
charges,
loaded,
aimed,
and
applied
the
match,
though
only
one
artilleryman
survived
out
of
every
three,
and
though
they
stumbled
and
panted
with
fatigue,
perspiring
and
stained
with
blood
and
powder.
The
cannon
balls
flew
just
as
swiftly
and
cruelly
from
both
sides,
crushing
human
bodies,
and
that
terrible
work
which
was
not
done
by
the
will
of
a
man
but
at
the
will
of
Him
who
governs
men
and
worlds
continued.
Anyone
looking
at
the
disorganized
rear
of
the
Russian
army
would
have
said
that,
if
only
the
French
made
one
more
slight
effort,
it
would
disappear;
and
anyone
looking
at
the
rear
of
the
French
army
would
have
said
that
the
Russians
need
only
make
one
more
slight
effort
and
the
French
would
be
destroyed.
But
neither
the
French
nor
the
Russians
made
that
effort,
and
the
flame
of
battle
burned
slowly
out.
The
Russians
did
not
make
that
effort
because
they
were
not
attacking
the
French.
At
the
beginning
of
the
battle
they
stood
blocking
the
way
to
Moscow
and
they
still
did
so
at
the
end
of
the
battle
as
at
the
beginning.
But
even
had
the
aim
of
the
Russians
been
to
drive
the
French
from
their
positions,
they
could
not
have
made
this
last
effort,
for
all
the
Russian
troops
had
been
broken
up,
there
was
no
part
of
the
Russian
army
that
had
not
suffered
in
the
battle,
and
though
still
holding
their
positions
they
had
lost
ONE
HALF
of
their
army.
The
French,
with
the
memory
of
all
their
former
victories
during
fifteen
years,
with
the
assurance
of
Napoleon's
invincibility,
with
the
consciousness
that
they
had
captured
part
of
the
battlefield
and
had
lost
only
a
quarter
of
their
men
and
still
had
their
Guards
intact,
twenty
thousand
strong,
might
easily
have
made
that
effort.
The
French
who
had
attacked
the
Russian
army
in
order
to
drive
it
from
its
position
ought
to
have
made
that
effort,
for
as
long
as
the
Russians
continued
to
block
the
road
to
Moscow
as
before,
the
aim
of
the
French
had
not
been
attained
and
all
their
efforts
and
losses
were
in
vain.
But
the
French
did
not
make
that
effort.
Some
historians
say
that
Napoleon
need
only
have
used
his
Old
Guards,
who
were
intact,
and
the
battle
would
have
been
won.
To
speak
of
what
would
have
happened
had
Napoleon
sent
his
Guards
is
like
talking
of
what
would
happen
if
autumn
became
spring.
It
could
not
be.
Napoleon
did
not
give
his
Guards,
not
because
he
did
not
want
to,
but
because
it
could
not
be
done.
All
the
generals,
officers,
and
soldiers
of
the
French
army
knew
it
could
not
be
done,
because
the
flagging
spirit
of
the
troops
would
not
permit
it.
It
was
not
Napoleon
alone
who
had
experienced
that
nightmare
feeling
of
the
mighty
arm
being
stricken
powerless,
but
all
the
generals
and
soldiers
of
his
army
whether
they
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
or
not,
after
all
their
experience
of
previous
battles--when
after
one
tenth
of
such
efforts
the
enemy
had
fled--experienced
a
similar
feeling
of
terror
before
an
enemy
who,
after
losing
HALF
his
men,
stood
as
threateningly
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle.
The
moral
force
of
the
attacking
French
army
was
exhausted.
Not
that
sort
of
victory
which
is
defined
by
the
capture
of
pieces
of
material
fastened
to
sticks,
called
standards,
and
of
the
ground
on
which
the
troops
had
stood
and
were
standing,
but
a
moral
victory
that
convinces
the
enemy
of
the
moral
superiority
of
his
opponent
and
of
his
own
impotence
was
gained
by
the
Russians
at
Borodino.
The
French
invaders,
like
an
infuriated
animal
that
has
in
its
onslaught
received
a
mortal
wound,
felt
that
they
were
perishing,
but
could
not
stop,
any
more
than
the
Russian
army,
weaker
by
one
half,
could
help
swerving.
By
impetus
gained,
the
French
army
was
still
able
to
roll
forward
to
Moscow,
but
there,
without
further
effort
on
the
part
of
the
Russians,
it
had
to
perish,
bleeding
from
the
mortal
wound
it
had
received
at
Borodino.
The
direct
consequence
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
Napoleon's
senseless
flight
from
Moscow,
his
retreat
along
the
old
Smolensk
road,
the
destruction
of
the
invading
army
of
five
hundred
thousand
men,
and
the
downfall
of
Napoleonic
France,
on
which
at
Borodino
for
the
first
time
the
hand
of
an
opponent
of
stronger
spirit
had
been
laid.

ELEVEN:
1812
CHAPTER
I
Absolute
continuity
of
motion
is
not
comprehensible
to
the
human
mind.
Laws
of
motion
of
any
kind
become
comprehensible
to
man
only
when
he
examines
arbitrarily
selected
elements
of
that
motion;
but
at
the
same
time,
a
large
proportion
of
human
error
comes
from
the
arbitrary
division
of
continuous
motion
into
discontinuous
elements.
There
is
a
well
known,
so-called
sophism
of
the
ancients
consisting
in
this,
that
Achilles
could
never
catch
up
with
a
tortoise
he
was
following,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
traveled
ten
times
as
fast
as
the
tortoise.
By
the
time
Achilles
has
covered
the
distance
that
separated
him
from
the
tortoise,
the
tortoise
has
covered
one
tenth
of
that
distance
ahead
of
him:
when
Achilles
has
covered
that
tenth,
the
tortoise
has
covered
another
one
hundredth,
and
so
on
forever.
This
problem
seemed
to
the
ancients
insoluble.
The
absurd
answer
(that
Achilles
could
never
overtake
the
tortoise)
resulted
from
this:
that
motion
was
arbitrarily
divided
into
discontinuous
elements,
whereas
the
motion
both
of
Achilles
and
of
the
tortoise
was
continuous.
By
adopting
smaller
and
smaller
elements
of
motion
we
only
approach
a
solution
of
the
problem,
but
never
reach
it.
Only
when
we
have
admitted
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
small,
and
the
resulting
geometrical
progression
with
a
common
ratio
of
one
tenth,
and
have
found
the
sum
of
this
progression
to
infinity,
do
we
reach
a
solution
of
the
problem.
A
modern
branch
of
mathematics
having
achieved
the
art
of
dealing
with
the
infinitely
small
can
now
yield
solutions
in
other
more
complex
problems
of
motion
which
used
to
appear
insoluble.
This
modern
branch
of
mathematics,
unknown
to
the
ancients,
when
dealing
with
problems
of
motion
admits
the
conception
of
the
infinitely
small,
and
so
conforms
to
the
chief
condition
of
motion
(absolute
continuity)
and
thereby
corrects
the
inevitable
error
which
the
human
mind
cannot
avoid
when
it
deals
with
separate
elements
of
motion
instead
of
examining
continuous
motion.
In
seeking
the
laws
of
historical
movement
just
the
same
thing
happens.
The
movement
of
humanity,
arising
as
it
does
from
innumerable
arbitrary
human
wills,
is
continuous.
To
understand
the
laws
of
this
continuous
movement
is
the
aim
of
history.
But
to
arrive
at
these
laws,
resulting
from
the
sum
of
all
those
human
wills,
man's
mind
postulates
arbitrary
and
disconnected
units.
The
first
method
of
history
is
to
take
an
arbitrarily
selected
series
of
continuous
events
and
examine
it
apart
from
others,
though
there
is
and
can
be
no
beginning
to
any
event,
for
one
event
always
flows
uninterruptedly
from
another.
The
second
method
is
to
consider
the
actions
of
some
one
man--a
king
or
a
commander--as
equivalent
to
the
sum
of
many
individual
wills;
whereas
the
sum
of
individual
wills
is
never
expressed
by
the
activity
of
a
single
historic
personage.
Historical
science
in
its
endeavor
to
draw
nearer
to
truth
continually
takes
smaller
and
smaller
units
for
examination.
But
however
small
the
units
it
takes,
we
feel
that
to
take
any
unit
disconnected
from
others,
or
to
assume
a
beginning
of
any
phenomenon,
or
to
say
that
the
will
of
many
men
is
expressed
by
the
actions
of
any
one
historic
personage,
is
in
itself
false.
It
needs
no
critical
exertion
to
reduce
utterly
to
dust
any
deductions
drawn
from
history.
It
is
merely
necessary
to
select
some
larger
or
smaller
unit
as
the
subject
of
observation--as
criticism
has
every
right
to
do,
seeing
that
whatever
unit
history
observes
must
always
be
arbitrarily
selected.
Only
by
taking
infinitesimally
small
units
for
observation
(the
differential
of
history,
that
is,
the
individual
tendencies
of
men)
and
attaining
to
the
art
of
integrating
them
(that
is,
finding
the
sum
of
these
infinitesimals)
can
we
hope
to
arrive
at
the
laws
of
history.
The
first
fifteen
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
Europe
present
an
extraordinary
movement
of
millions
of
people.
Men
leave
their
customary
pursuits,
hasten
from
one
side
of
Europe
to
the
other,
plunder
and
slaughter
one
another,
triumph
and
are
plunged
in
despair,
and
for
some
years
the
whole
course
of
life
is
altered
and
presents
an
intensive
movement
which
first
increases
and
then
slackens.
What
was
the
cause
of
this
movement,
by
what
laws
was
it
governed?
asks
the
mind
of
man.
The
historians,
replying
to
this
question,
lay
before
us
the
sayings
and
doings
of
a
few
dozen
men
in
a
building
in
the
city
of
Paris,
calling
these
sayings
and
doings
"the
Revolution";
then
they
give
a
detailed
biography
of
Napoleon
and
of
certain
people
favorable
or
hostile
to
him;
tell
of
the
influence
some
of
these
people
had
on
others,
and
say:
that
is
why
this
movement
took
place
and
those
are
its
laws.
But
the
mind
of
man
not
only
refuses
to
believe
this
explanation,
but
plainly
says
that
this
method
of
explanation
is
fallacious,
because
in
it
a
weaker
phenomenon
is
taken
as
the
cause
of
a
stronger.
The
sum
of
human
wills
produced
the
Revolution
and
Napoleon,
and
only
the
sum
of
those
wills
first
tolerated
and
then
destroyed
them.
"But
every
time
there
have
been
conquests
there
have
been
conquerors;
every
time
there
has
been
a
revolution
in
any
state
there
have
been
great
men,"
says
history.
And,
indeed,
human
reason
replies:
every
time
conquerors
appear
there
have
been
wars,
but
this
does
not
prove
that
the
conquerors
caused
the
wars
and
that
it
is
possible
to
find
the
laws
of
a
war
in
the
personal
activity
of
a
single
man.
Whenever
I
look
at
my
watch
and
its
hands
point
to
ten,
I
hear
the
bells
of
the
neighboring
church;
but
because
the
bells
begin
to
ring
when
the
hands
of
the
clock
reach
ten,
I
have
no
right
to
assume
that
the
movement
of
the
bells
is
caused
by
the
position
of
the
hands
of
the
watch.
Whenever
I
see
the
movement
of
a
locomotive
I
hear
the
whistle
and
see
the
valves
opening
and
wheels
turning;
but
I
have
no
right
to
conclude
that
the
whistling
and
the
turning
of
wheels
are
the
cause
of
the
movement
of
the
engine.
The
peasants
say
that
a
cold
wind
blows
in
late
spring
because
the
oaks
are
budding,
and
really
every
spring
cold
winds
do
blow
when
the
oak
is
budding.
But
though
I
do
not
know
what
causes
the
cold
winds
to
blow
when
the
oak
buds
unfold,
I
cannot
agree
with
the
peasants
that
the
unfolding
of
the
oak
buds
is
the
cause
of
the
cold
wind,
for
the
force
of
the
wind
is
beyond
the
influence
of
the
buds.
I
see
only
a
coincidence
of
occurrences
such
as
happens
with
all
the
phenomena
of
life,
and
I
see
that
however
much
and
however
carefully
I
observe
the
hands
of
the
watch,
and
the
valves
and
wheels
of
the
engine,
and
the
oak,
I
shall
not
discover
the
cause
of
the
bells
ringing,
the
engine
moving,
or
of
the
winds
of
spring.
To
that
I
must
entirely
change
my
point
of
view
and
study
the
laws
of
the
movement
of
steam,
of
the
bells,
and
of
the
wind.
History
must
do
the
same.
And
attempts
in
this
direction
have
already
been
made.
To
study
the
laws
of
history
we
must
completely
change
the
subject
of
our
observation,
must
leave
aside
kings,
ministers,
and
generals,
and
study
the
common,
infinitesimally
small
elements
by
which
the
masses
are
moved.
No
one
can
say
in
how
far
it
is
possible
for
man
to
advance
in
this
way
toward
an
understanding
of
the
laws
of
history;
but
it
is
evident
that
only
along
that
path
does
the
possibility
of
discovering
the
laws
of
history
lie,
and
that
as
yet
not
a
millionth
part
as
much
mental
effort
has
been
applied
in
this
direction
by
historians
as
has
been
devoted
to
describing
the
actions
of
various
kings,
commanders,
and
ministers
and
propounding
the
historians'
own
reflections
concerning
these
actions.
CHAPTER
II
The
forces
of
a
dozen
European
nations
burst
into
Russia.
The
Russian
army
and
people
avoided
a
collision
till
Smolensk
was
reached,
and
again
from
Smolensk
to
Borodino.
The
French
army
pushed
on
to
Moscow,
its
goal,
its
impetus
ever
increasing
as
it
neared
its
aim,
just
as
the
velocity
of
a
falling
body
increases
as
it
approaches
the
earth.
Behind
it
were
seven
hundred
miles
of
hunger-stricken,
hostile
country;
ahead
were
a
few
dozen
miles
separating
it
from
its
goal.
Every
soldier
in
Napoleon's
army
felt
this
and
the
invasion
moved
on
by
its
own
momentum.
The
more
the
Russian
army
retreated
the
more
fiercely
a
spirit
of
hatred
of
the
enemy
flared
up,
and
while
it
retreated
the
army
increased
and
consolidated.
At
Borodino
a
collision
took
place.
Neither
army
was
broken
up,
but
the
Russian
army
retreated
immediately
after
the
collision
as
inevitably
as
a
ball
recoils
after
colliding
with
another
having
a
greater
momentum,
and
with
equal
inevitability
the
ball
of
invasion
that
had
advanced
with
such
momentum
rolled
on
for
some
distance,
though
the
collision
had
deprived
it
of
all
its
force.
The
Russians
retreated
eighty
miles--to
beyond
Moscow--and
the
French
reached
Moscow
and
there
came
to
a
standstill.
For
five
weeks
after
that
there
was
not
a
single
battle.
The
French
did
not
move.
As
a
bleeding,
mortally
wounded
animal
licks
its
wounds,
they
remained
inert
in
Moscow
for
five
weeks,
and
then
suddenly,
with
no
fresh
reason,
fled
back:
they
made
a
dash
for
the
Kaluga
road,
and
(after
a
victory--for
at
Malo-
Yaroslavets
the
field
of
conflict
again
remained
theirs)
without
undertaking
a
single
serious
battle,
they
fled
still
more
rapidly
back
to
Smolensk,
beyond
Smolensk,
beyond
the
Berezina,
beyond
Vilna,
and
farther
still.
On
the
evening
of
the
twenty-sixth
of
August,
Kutuzov
and
the
whole
Russian
army
were
convinced
that
the
battle
of
Borodino
was
a
victory.
Kutuzov
reported
so
to
the
Emperor.
He
gave
orders
to
prepare
for
a
fresh
conflict
to
finish
the
enemy
and
did
this
not
to
deceive
anyone,
but
because
he
knew
that
the
enemy
was
beaten,
as
everyone
who
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
knew
it.
But
all
that
evening
and
next
day
reports
came
in
one
after
another
of
unheard-of
losses,
of
the
loss
of
half
the
army,
and
a
fresh
battle
proved
physically
impossible.
It
was
impossible
to
give
battle
before
information
had
been
collected,
the
wounded
gathered
in,
the
supplies
of
ammunition
replenished,
the
slain
reckoned
up,
new
officers
appointed
to
replace
those
who
had
been
killed,
and
before
the
men
had
had
food
and
sleep.
And
meanwhile,
the
very
next
morning
after
the
battle,
the
French
army
advanced
of
itself
upon
the
Russians,
carried
forward
by
the
force
of
its
own
momentum
now
seemingly
increased
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
distance
from
its
aim.
Kutuzov's
wish
was
to
attack
next
day,
and
the
whole
army
desired
to
do
so.
But
to
make
an
attack
the
wish
to
do
so
is
not
sufficient,
there
must
also
be
a
possibility
of
doing
it,
and
that
possibility
did
not
exist.
It
was
impossible
not
to
retreat
a
day's
march,
and
then
in
the
same
way
it
was
impossible
not
to
retreat
another
and
a
third
day's
march,
and
at
last,
on
the
first
of
September
when
the
army
drew
near
Moscow--despite
the
strength
of
the
feeling
that
had
arisen
in
all
ranks--the
force
of
circumstances
compelled
it
to
retire
beyond
Moscow.
And
the
troops
retired
one
more,
last,
day's
march,
and
abandoned
Moscow
to
the
enemy.
For
people
accustomed
to
think
that
plans
of
campaign
and
battles
are
made
by
generals--as
any
one
of
us
sitting
over
a
map
in
his
study
may
imagine
how
he
would
have
arranged
things
in
this
or
that
battle--the
questions
present
themselves:
Why
did
Kutuzov
during
the
retreat
not
do
this
or
that?
Why
did
he
not
take
up
a
position
before
reaching
Fili?
Why
did
he
not
retire
at
once
by
the
Kaluga
road,
abandoning
Moscow?
and
so
on.
People
accustomed
to
think
in
that
way
forget,
or
do
not
know,
the
inevitable
conditions
which
always
limit
the
activities
of
any
commander
in
chief.
The
activity
of
a
commander-in-chief
does
not
at
all
resemble
the
activity
we
imagine
to
ourselves
when
we
sit
at
ease
in
our
studies
examining
some
campaign
on
the
map,
with
a
certain
number
of
troops
on
this
and
that
side
in
a
certain
known
locality,
and
begin
our
plans
from
some
given
moment.
A
commander-in-chief
is
never
dealing
with
the
beginning
of
any
event--the
position
from
which
we
always
contemplate
it.
The
commander-in-chief
is
always
in
the
midst
of
a
series
of
shifting
events
and
so
he
never
can
at
any
moment
consider
the
whole
import
of
an
event
that
is
occurring.
Moment
by
moment
the
event
is
imperceptibly
shaping
itself,
and
at
every
moment
of
this
continuous,
uninterrupted
shaping
of
events
the
commander-in-chief
is
in
the
midst
of
a
most
complex
play
of
intrigues,
worries,
contingencies,
authorities,
projects,
counsels,
threats,
and
deceptions
and
is
continually
obliged
to
reply
to
innumerable
questions
addressed
to
him,
which
constantly
conflict
with
one
another.
Learned
military
authorities
quite
seriously
tell
us
that
Kutuzov
should
have
moved
his
army
to
the
Kaluga
road
long
before
reaching
Fili,
and
that
somebody
actually
submitted
such
a
proposal
to
him.
But
a
commander
in
chief,
especially
at
a
difficult
moment,
has
always
before
him
not
one
proposal
but
dozens
simultaneously.
And
all
these
proposals,
based
on
strategics
and
tactics,
contradict
each
other.
A
commander-in-chief's
business,
it
would
seem,
is
simply
to
choose
one
of
these
projects.
But
even
that
he
cannot
do.
Events
and
time
do
not
wait.
For
instance,
on
the
twenty-eighth
it
is
suggested
to
him
to
cross
to
the
Kaluga
road,
but
just
then
an
adjutant
gallops
up
from
Miloradovich
asking
whether
he
is
to
engage
the
French
or
retire.
An
order
must
be
given
him
at
once,
that
instant.
And
the
order
to
retreat
carries
us
past
the
turn
to
the
Kaluga
road.
And
after
the
adjutant
comes
the
commissary
general
asking
where
the
stores
are
to
be
taken,
and
the
chief
of
the
hospitals
asks
where
the
wounded
are
to
go,
and
a
courier
from
Petersburg
brings
a
letter
from
the
sovereign
which
does
not
admit
of
the
possibility
of
abandoning
Moscow,
and
the
commander-in-
chief's
rival,
the
man
who
is
undermining
him
(and
there
are
always
not
merely
one
but
several
such),
presents
a
new
project
diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
turning
to
the
Kaluga
road,
and
the
commander-in-
chief
himself
needs
sleep
and
refreshment
to
maintain
his
energy
and
a
respectable
general
who
has
been
overlooked
in
the
distribution
of
rewards
comes
to
complain,
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
district
pray
to
be
defended,
and
an
officer
sent
to
inspect
the
locality
comes
in
and
gives
a
report
quite
contrary
to
what
was
said
by
the
officer
previously
sent;
and
a
spy,
a
prisoner,
and
a
general
who
has
been
on
reconnaissance,
all
describe
the
position
of
the
enemy's
army
differently.
People
accustomed
to
misunderstand
or
to
forget
these
inevitable
conditions
of
a
commander-in-chief's
actions
describe
to
us,
for
instance,
the
position
of
the
army
at
Fili
and
assume
that
the
commander-in-chief
could,
on
the
first
of
September,
quite
freely
decide
whether
to
abandon
Moscow
or
defend
it;
whereas,
with
the
Russian
army
less
than
four
miles
from
Moscow,
no
such
question
existed.
When
had
that
question
been
settled?
At
Drissa
and
at
Smolensk
and
most
palpably
of
all
on
the
twenty-fourth
of
August
at
Shevardino
and
on
the
twenty-
sixth
at
Borodino,
and
each
day
and
hour
and
minute
of
the
retreat
from
Borodino
to
Fili.
CHAPTER
III
When
Ermolov,
having
been
sent
by
Kutuzov
to
inspect
the
position,
told
the
field
marshal
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
there
before
Moscow
and
that
they
must
retreat,
Kutuzov
looked
at
him
in
silence.
"Give
me
your
hand,"
said
he
and,
turning
it
over
so
as
to
feel
the
pulse,
added:
"You
are
not
well,
my
dear
fellow.
Think
what
you
are
saying!"
Kutuzov
could
not
yet
admit
the
possibility
of
retreating
beyond
Moscow
without
a
battle.
On
the
Poklonny
Hill,
four
miles
from
the
Dorogomilov
gate
of
Moscow,
Kutuzov
got
out
of
his
carriage
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
by
the
roadside.
A
great
crowd
of
generals
gathered
round
him,
and
Count
Rostopchin,
who
had
come
out
from
Moscow,
joined
them.
This
brilliant
company
separated
into
several
groups
who
all
discussed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
the
position,
the
state
of
the
army,
the
plans
suggested,
the
situation
of
Moscow,
and
military
questions
generally.
Though
they
had
not
been
summoned
for
the
purpose,
and
though
it
was
not
so
called,
they
all
felt
that
this
was
really
a
council
of
war.
The
conversations
all
dealt
with
public
questions.
If
anyone
gave
or
asked
for
personal
news,
it
was
done
in
a
whisper
and
they
immediately
reverted
to
general
matters.
No
jokes,
or
laughter,
or
smiles
even,
were
seen
among
all
these
men.
They
evidently
all
made
an
effort
to
hold
themselves
at
the
height
the
situation
demanded.
And
all
these
groups,
while
talking
among
themselves,
tried
to
keep
near
the
commander-in-chief
(whose
bench
formed
the
center
of
the
gathering)
and
to
speak
so
that
he
might
overhear
them.
The
commander
in
chief
listened
to
what
was
being
said
and
sometimes
asked
them
to
repeat
their
remarks,
but
did
not
himself
take
part
in
the
conversations
or
express
any
opinion.
After
hearing
what
was
being
said
by
one
or
other
of
these
groups
he
generally
turned
away
with
an
air
of
disappointment,
as
though
they
were
not
speaking
of
anything
he
wished
to
hear.
Some
discussed
the
position
that
had
been
chosen,
criticizing
not
the
position
itself
so
much
as
the
mental
capacity
of
those
who
had
chosen
it.
Others
argued
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
earlier
and
that
a
battle
should
have
been
fought
two
days
before.
Others
again
spoke
of
the
battle
of
Salamanca,
which
was
described
by
Crosart,
a
newly
arrived
Frenchman
in
a
Spanish
uniform.
(This
Frenchman
and
one
of
the
German
princes
serving
with
the
Russian
army
were
discussing
the
siege
of
Saragossa
and
considering
the
possibility
of
defending
Moscow
in
a
similar
manner.)
Count
Rostopchin
was
telling
a
fourth
group
that
he
was
prepared
to
die
with
the
city
train
bands
under
the
walls
of
the
capital,
but
that
he
still
could
not
help
regretting
having
been
left
in
ignorance
of
what
was
happening,
and
that
had
he
known
it
sooner
things
would
have
been
different....
A
fifth
group,
displaying
the
profundity
of
their
strategic
perceptions,
discussed
the
direction
the
troops
would
now
have
to
take.
A
sixth
group
was
talking
absolute
nonsense.
Kutuzov's
expression
grew
more
and
more
preoccupied
and
gloomy.
From
all
this
talk
he
saw
only
one
thing:
that
to
defend
Moscow
was
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
full
meaning
of
those
words,
that
is
to
say,
so
utterly
impossible
that
if
any
senseless
commander
were
to
give
orders
to
fight,
confusion
would
result
but
the
battle
would
still
not
take
place.
It
would
not
take
place
because
the
commanders
not
merely
all
recognized
the
position
to
be
impossible,
but
in
their
conversations
were
only
discussing
what
would
happen
after
its
inevitable
abandonment.
How
could
the
commanders
lead
their
troops
to
a
field
of
battle
they
considered
impossible
to
hold?
The
lower-grade
officers
and
even
the
soldiers
(who
too
reason)
also
considered
the
position
impossible
and
therefore
could
not
go
to
fight,
fully
convinced
as
they
were
of
defeat.
If
Bennigsen
insisted
on
the
position
being
defended
and
others
still
discussed
it,
the
question
was
no
longer
important
in
itself
but
only
as
a
pretext
for
disputes
and
intrigue.
This
Kutuzov
knew
well.
Bennigsen,
who
had
chosen
the
position,
warmly
displayed
his
Russian
patriotism
(Kutuzov
could
not
listen
to
this
without
wincing)
by
insisting
that
Moscow
must
be
defended.
His
aim
was
as
clear
as
daylight
to
Kutuzov:
if
the
defense
failed,
to
throw
the
blame
on
Kutuzov
who
had
brought
the
army
as
far
as
the
Sparrow
Hills
without
giving
battle;
if
it
succeeded,
to
claim
the
success
as
his
own;
or
if
battle
were
not
given,
to
clear
himself
of
the
crime
of
abandoning
Moscow.
But
this
intrigue
did
not
now
occupy
the
old
man's
mind.
One
terrible
question
absorbed
him
and
to
that
question
he
heard
no
reply
from
anyone.
The
question
for
him
now
was:
"Have
I
really
allowed
Napoleon
to
reach
Moscow,
and
when
did
I
do
so?
When
was
it
decided?
Can
it
have
been
yesterday
when
I
ordered
Platov
to
retreat,
or
was
it
the
evening
before,
when
I
had
a
nap
and
told
Bennigsen
to
issue
orders?
Or
was
it
earlier
still?...
When,
when
was
this
terrible
affair
decided?
Moscow
must
be
abandoned.
The
army
must
retreat
and
the
order
to
do
so
must
be
given."
To
give
that
terrible
order
seemed
to
him
equivalent
to
resigning
the
command
of
the
army.
And
not
only
did
he
love
power
to
which
he
was
accustomed
(the
honours
awarded
to
Prince
Prozorovski,
under
whom
he
had
served
in
Turkey,
galled
him),
but
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
destined
to
save
Russia
and
that
that
was
why,
against
the
Emperor's
wish
and
by
the
will
of
the
people,
he
had
been
chosen
commander-in-chief.
He
was
convinced
that
he
alone
could
maintain
command
of
the
army
in
these
difficult
circumstances,
and
that
in
all
the
world
he
alone
could
encounter
the
invincible
Napoleon
without
fear,
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
order
he
had
to
issue.
But
something
had
to
be
decided,
and
these
conversations
around
him
which
were
assuming
too
free
a
character
must
be
stopped.
He
called
the
most
important
generals
to
him.
"My
head,
be
it
good
or
bad,
must
depend
on
itself,"
said
he,
rising
from
the
bench,
and
he
rode
to
Fili
where
his
carriages
were
waiting.
CHAPTER
IV
The
Council
of
War
began
to
assemble
at
two
in
the
afternoon
in
the
better
and
roomier
part
of
Andrew
Savostyanov's
hut.
The
men,
women,
and
children
of
the
large
peasant
family
crowded
into
the
back
room
across
the
passage.
Only
Malasha,
Andrew's
six-year-old
granddaughter
whom
his
Serene
Highness
had
petted
and
to
whom
he
had
given
a
lump
of
sugar
while
drinking
his
tea,
remained
on
the
top
of
the
brick
oven
in
the
larger
room.
Malasha
looked
down
from
the
oven
with
shy
delight
at
the
faces,
uniforms,
and
decorations
of
the
generals,
who
one
after
another
came
into
the
room
and
sat
down
on
the
broad
benches
in
the
corner
under
the
icons.
"Granddad"
himself,
as
Malasha
in
her
own
mind
called
Kutuzov,
sat
apart
in
a
dark
corner
behind
the
oven.
He
sat,
sunk
deep
in
a
folding
armchair,
and
continually
cleared
his
throat
and
pulled
at
the
collar
of
his
coat
which,
though
it
was
unbuttoned,
still
seemed
to
pinch
his
neck.
Those
who
entered
went
up
one
by
one
to
the
field
marshal;
he
pressed
the
hands
of
some
and
nodded
to
others.
His
adjutant
Kaysarov
was
about
to
draw
back
the
curtain
of
the
window
facing
Kutuzov,
but
the
latter
moved
his
hand
angrily
and
Kaysarov
understood
that
his
Serene
Highness
did
not
wish
his
face
to
be
seen.
Round
the
peasant's
deal
table,
on
which
lay
maps,
plans,
pencils,
and
papers,
so
many
people
gathered
that
the
orderlies
brought
in
another
bench
and
put
it
beside
the
table.
Ermolov,
Kaysarov,
and
Toll,
who
had
just
arrived,
sat
down
on
this
bench.
In
the
foremost
place,
immediately
under
the
icons,
sat
Barclay
de
Tolly,
his
high
forehead
merging
into
his
bald
crown.
He
had
a
St.
George's
Cross
round
his
neck
and
looked
pale
and
ill.
He
had
been
feverish
for
two
days
and
was
now
shivering
and
in
pain.
Beside
him
sat
Uvarov,
who
with
rapid
gesticulations
was
giving
him
some
information,
speaking
in
low
tones
as
they
all
did.
Chubby
little
Dokhturov
was
listening
attentively
with
eyebrows
raised
and
arms
folded
on
his
stomach.
On
the
other
side
sat
Count
Ostermann-
Tolstoy,
seemingly
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts.
His
broad
head
with
its
bold
features
and
glittering
eyes
was
resting
on
his
hand.
Raevski,
twitching
forward
the
black
hair
on
his
temples
as
was
his
habit,
glanced
now
at
Kutuzov
and
now
at
the
door
with
a
look
of
impatience.
Konovnitsyn's
firm,
handsome,
and
kindly
face
was
lit
up
by
a
tender,
sly
smile.
His
glance
met
Malasha's,
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
caused
the
little
girl
to
smile.
They
were
all
waiting
for
Bennigsen,
who
on
the
pretext
of
inspecting
the
position
was
finishing
his
savory
dinner.
They
waited
for
him
from
four
till
six
o'clock
and
did
not
begin
their
deliberations
all
that
time
but
talked
in
low
tones
of
other
matters.
Only
when
Bennigsen
had
entered
the
hut
did
Kutuzov
leave
his
corner
and
draw
toward
the
table,
but
not
near
enough
for
the
candles
that
had
been
placed
there
to
light
up
his
face.
Bennigsen
opened
the
council
with
the
question:
"Are
we
to
abandon
Russia's
ancient
and
sacred
capital
without
a
struggle,
or
are
we
to
defend
it?"
A
prolonged
and
general
silence
followed.
There
was
a
frown
on
every
face
and
only
Kutuzov's
angry
grunts
and
occasional
cough
broke
the
silence.
All
eyes
were
gazing
at
him.
Malasha
too
looked
at
"Granddad."
She
was
nearest
to
him
and
saw
how
his
face
puckered;
he
seemed
about
to
cry,
but
this
did
not
last
long.
"Russia's
ancient
and
sacred
capital!"
he
suddenly
said,
repeating
Bennigsen's
words
in
an
angry
voice
and
thereby
drawing
attention
to
the
false
note
in
them.
"Allow
me
to
tell
you,
your
excellency,
that
that
question
has
no
meaning
for
a
Russian."
(He
lurched
his
heavy
body
forward.)
"Such
a
question
cannot
be
put;
it
is
senseless!
The
question
I
have
asked
these
gentlemen
to
meet
to
discuss
is
a
military
one.
The
question
is
that
of
saving
Russia.
Is
it
better
to
give
up
Moscow
without
a
battle,
or
by
accepting
battle
to
risk
losing
the
army
as
well
as
Moscow?
That
is
the
question
on
which
I
want
your
opinion,"
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair.
The
discussion
began.
Bennigsen
did
not
yet
consider
his
game
lost.
Admitting
the
view
of
Barclay
and
others
that
a
defensive
battle
at
Fili
was
impossible,
but
imbued
with
Russian
patriotism
and
the
love
of
Moscow,
he
proposed
to
move
troops
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
during
the
night
and
attack
the
French
right
flank
the
following
day.
Opinions
were
divided,
and
arguments
were
advanced
for
and
against
that
project.
Ermolov,
Dokhturov,
and
Raevski
agreed
with
Bennigsen.
Whether
feeling
it
necessary
to
make
a
sacrifice
before
abandoning
the
capital
or
guided
by
other,
personal
considerations,
these
generals
seemed
not
to
understand
that
this
council
could
not
alter
the
inevitable
course
of
events
and
that
Moscow
was
in
effect
already
abandoned.
The
other
generals,
however,
understood
it
and,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
Moscow,
spoke
of
the
direction
the
army
should
take
in
its
retreat.
Malasha,
who
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
what
was
going
on
before
her,
understood
the
meaning
of
the
council
differently.
It
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
only
a
personal
struggle
between
"Granddad"
and
"Long-coat"
as
she
termed
Bennigsen.
She
saw
that
they
grew
spiteful
when
they
spoke
to
one
another,
and
in
her
heart
she
sided
with
"Granddad."
In
the
midst
of
the
conversation
she
noticed
"Granddad"
give
Bennigsen
a
quick,
subtle
glance,
and
then
to
her
joys
she
saw
that
"Granddad"
said
something
to
"Long-coat"
which
settled
him.
Bennigsen
suddenly
reddened
and
paced
angrily
up
and
down
the
room.
What
so
affected
him
was
Kutuzov's
calm
and
quiet
comment
on
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
Bennigsen's
proposal
to
move
troops
by
night
from
the
right
to
the
left
flank
to
attack
the
French
right
wing.
"Gentlemen,"
said
Kutuzov,
"I
cannot
approve
of
the
count's
plan.
Moving
troops
in
close
proximity
to
an
enemy
is
always
dangerous,
and
military
history
supports
that
view.
For
instance..."
Kutuzov
seemed
to
reflect,
searching
for
an
example,
then
with
a
clear,
naive
look
at
Bennigsen
he
added:
"Oh
yes;
take
the
battle
of
Friedland,
which
I
think
the
count
well
remembers,
and
which
was...
not
fully
successful,
only
because
our
troops
were
rearranged
too
near
the
enemy..."
There
followed
a
momentary
pause,
which
seemed
very
long
to
them
all.
The
discussion
recommenced,
but
pauses
frequently
occurred
and
they
all
felt
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
said.
During
one
of
these
pauses
Kutuzov
heaved
a
deep
sigh
as
if
preparing
to
speak.
They
all
looked
at
him.
"Well,
gentlemen,
I
see
that
it
is
I
who
will
have
to
pay
for
the
broken
crockery,"
said
he,
and
rising
slowly
he
moved
to
the
table.
"Gentlemen,
I
have
heard
your
views.
Some
of
you
will
not
agree
with
me.
But
I,"
he
paused,
"by
the
authority
entrusted
to
me
by
my
Sovereign
and
country,
order
a
retreat."
After
that
the
generals
began
to
disperse
with
the
solemnity
and
circumspect
silence
of
people
who
are
leaving,
after
a
funeral.
Some
of
the
generals,
in
low
tones
and
in
a
strain
very
different
from
the
way
they
had
spoken
during
the
council,
communicated
something
to
their
commander-in-chief.
Malasha,
who
had
long
been
expected
for
supper,
climbed
carefully
backwards
down
from
the
oven,
her
bare
little
feet
catching
at
its
projections,
and
slipping
between
the
legs
of
the
generals
she
darted
out
of
the
room.
When
he
had
dismissed
the
generals
Kutuzov
sat
a
long
time
with
his
elbows
on
the
table,
thinking
always
of
the
same
terrible
question:
"When,
when
did
the
abandonment
of
Moscow
become
inevitable?
When
was
that
done
which
settled
the
matter?
And
who
was
to
blame
for
it?"
"I
did
not
expect
this,"
said
he
to
his
adjutant
Schneider
when
the
latter
came
in
late
that
night.
"I
did
not
expect
this!
I
did
not
think
this
would
happen."
"You
should
take
some
rest,
your
Serene
Highness,"
replied
Schneider.
"But
no!
They
shall
eat
horseflesh
yet,
like
the
Turks!"
exclaimed
Kutuzov
without
replying,
striking
the
table
with
his
podgy
fist.
"They
shall
too,
if
only..."
CHAPTER
V
At
that
very
time,
in
circumstances
even
more
important
than
retreating
without
a
battle,
namely
the
evacuation
and
burning
of
Moscow,
Rostopchin,
who
is
usually
represented
as
being
the
instigator
of
that
event,
acted
in
an
altogether
different
manner
from
Kutuzov.
After
the
battle
of
Borodino
the
abandonment
and
burning
of
Moscow
was
as
inevitable
as
the
retreat
of
the
army
beyond
Moscow
without
fighting.
Every
Russian
might
have
predicted
it,
not
by
reasoning
but
by
the
feeling
implanted
in
each
of
us
and
in
our
fathers.
The
same
thing
that
took
place
in
Moscow
had
happened
in
all
the
towns
and
villages
on
Russian
soil
beginning
with
Smolensk,
without
the
participation
of
Count
Rostopchin
and
his
broadsheets.
The
people
awaited
the
enemy
unconcernedly,
did
not
riot
or
become
excited
or
tear
anyone
to
pieces,
but
faced
its
fate,
feeling
within
it
the
strength
to
find
what
it
should
do
at
that
most
difficult
moment.
And
as
soon
as
the
enemy
drew
near
the
wealthy
classes
went
away
abandoning
their
property,
while
the
poorer
remained
and
burned
and
destroyed
what
was
left.
The
consciousness
that
this
would
be
so
and
would
always
be
so
was
and
is
present
in
the
heart
of
every
Russian.
And
a
consciousness
of
this,
and
a
foreboding
that
Moscow
would
be
taken,
was
present
in
Russian
Moscow
society
in
1812.
Those
who
had
quitted
Moscow
already
in
July
and
at
the
beginning
of
August
showed
that
they
expected
this.
Those
who
went
away,
taking
what
they
could
and
abandoning
their
houses
and
half
their
belongings,
did
so
from
the
latent
patriotism
which
expresses
itself
not
by
phrases
or
by
giving
one's
children
to
save
the
fatherland
and
similar
unnatural
exploits,
but
unobtrusively,
simply,
organically,
and
therefore
in
the
way
that
always
produces
the
most
powerful
results.
"It
is
disgraceful
to
run
away
from
danger;
only
cowards
are
running
away
from
Moscow,"
they
were
told.
In
his
broadsheets
Rostopchin
impressed
on
them
that
to
leave
Moscow
was
shameful.
They
were
ashamed
to
be
called
cowards,
ashamed
to
leave,
but
still
they
left,
knowing
it
had
to
be
done.
Why
did
they
go?
It
is
impossible
to
suppose
that
Rostopchin
had
scared
them
by
his
accounts
of
horrors
Napoleon
had
committed
in
conquered
countries.
The
first
people
to
go
away
were
the
rich
educated
people
who
knew
quite
well
that
Vienna
and
Berlin
had
remained
intact
and
that
during
Napoleon's
occupation
the
inhabitants
had
spent
their
time
pleasantly
in
the
company
of
the
charming
Frenchmen
whom
the
Russians,
and
especially
the
Russian
ladies,
then
liked
so
much.
They
went
away
because
for
Russians
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
whether
things
would
go
well
or
ill
under
French
rule
in
Moscow.
It
was
out
of
the
question
to
be
under
French
rule,
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen.
They
went
away
even
before
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
still
more
rapidly
after
it,
despite
Rostopchin's
calls
to
defend
Moscow
or
the
announcement
of
his
intention
to
take
the
wonder-working
icon
of
the
Iberian
Mother
of
God
and
go
to
fight,
or
of
the
balloons
that
were
to
destroy
the
French,
and
despite
all
the
nonsense
Rostopchin
wrote
in
his
broadsheets.
They
knew
that
it
was
for
the
army
to
fight,
and
that
if
it
could
not
succeed
it
would
not
do
to
take
young
ladies
and
house
serfs
to
the
Three
Hills
quarter
of
Moscow
to
fight
Napoleon,
and
that
they
must
go
away,
sorry
as
they
were
to
abandon
their
property
to
destruction.
They
went
away
without
thinking
of
the
tremendous
significance
of
that
immense
and
wealthy
city
being
given
over
to
destruction,
for
a
great
city
with
wooden
buildings
was
certain
when
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
to
be
burned.
They
went
away
each
on
his
own
account,
and
yet
it
was
only
in
consequence
of
their
going
away
that
the
momentous
event
was
accomplished
that
will
always
remain
the
greatest
glory
of
the
Russian
people.
The
lady
who,
afraid
of
being
stopped
by
Count
Rostopchin's
orders,
had
already
in
June
moved
with
her
Negroes
and
her
women
jesters
from
Moscow
to
her
Saratov
estate,
with
a
vague
consciousness
that
she
was
not
Bonaparte's
servant,
was
really,
simply,
and
truly
carrying
out
the
great
work
which
saved
Russia.
But
Count
Rostopchin,
who
now
taunted
those
who
left
Moscow
and
now
had
the
government
offices
removed;
now
distributed
quite
useless
weapons
to
the
drunken
rabble;
now
had
processions
displaying
the
icons,
and
now
forbade
Father
Augustin
to
remove
icons
or
the
relics
of
saints;
now
seized
all
the
private
carts
in
Moscow
and
on
one
hundred
and
thirty-six
of
them
removed
the
balloon
that
was
being
constructed
by
Leppich;
now
hinted
that
he
would
burn
Moscow
and
related
how
he
had
set
fire
to
his
own
house;
now
wrote
a
proclamation
to
the
French
solemnly
upbraiding
them
for
having
destroyed
his
Orphanage;
now
claimed
the
glory
of
having
hinted
that
he
would
burn
Moscow
and
now
repudiated
the
deed;
now
ordered
the
people
to
catch
all
spies
and
bring
them
to
him,
and
now
reproached
them
for
doing
so;
now
expelled
all
the
French
residents
from
Moscow,
and
now
allowed
Madame
Aubert-Chalme
(the
center
of
the
whole
French
colony
in
Moscow)
to
remain,
but
ordered
the
venerable
old
postmaster
Klyucharev
to
be
arrested
and
exiled
for
no
particular
offense;
now
assembled
the
people
at
the
Three
Hills
to
fight
the
French
and
now,
to
get
rid
of
them,
handed
over
to
them
a
man
to
be
killed
and
himself
drove
away
by
a
back
gate;
now
declared
that
he
would
not
survive
the
fall
of
Moscow,
and
now
wrote
French
verses
in
albums
concerning
his
share
in
the
affair--this
man
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
was
happening
but
merely
wanted
to
do
something
himself
that
would
astonish
people,
to
perform
some
patriotically
heroic
feat;
and
like
a
child
he
made
sport
of
the
momentous,
and
unavoidable
event--
the
abandonment
and
burning
of
Moscow--and
tried
with
his
puny
hand
now
to
speed
and
now
to
stay
the
enormous,
popular
tide
that
bore
him
along
with
it.
CHAPTER
VI
Helene,
having
returned
with
the
court
from
Vilna
to
Petersburg,
found
herself
in
a
difficult
position.
In
Petersburg
she
had
enjoyed
the
special
protection
of
a
grandee
who
occupied
one
of
the
highest
posts
in
the
Empire.
In
Vilna
she
had
formed
an
intimacy
with
a
young
foreign
prince.
When
she
returned
to
Petersburg
both
the
magnate
and
the
prince
were
there,
and
both
claimed
their
rights.
Helene
was
faced
by
a
new
problem--how
to
preserve
her
intimacy
with
both
without
offending
either.
What
would
have
seemed
difficult
or
even
impossible
to
another
woman
did
not
cause
the
least
embarrassment
to
Countess
Bezukhova,
who
evidently
deserved
her
reputation
of
being
a
very
clever
woman.
Had
she
attempted
concealment,
or
tried
to
extricate
herself
from
her
awkward
position
by
cunning,
she
would
have
spoiled
her
case
by
acknowledging
herself
guilty.
But
Helene,
like
a
really
great
man
who
can
do
whatever
he
pleases,
at
once
assumed
her
own
position
to
be
correct,
as
she
sincerely
believed
it
to
be,
and
that
everyone
else
was
to
blame.
The
first
time
the
young
foreigner
allowed
himself
to
reproach
her,
she
lifted
her
beautiful
head
and,
half
turning
to
him,
said
firmly:
"That's
just
like
a
man--selfish
and
cruel!
I
expected
nothing
else.
A
woman
sacrifices
herself
for
you,
she
suffers,
and
this
is
her
reward!
What
right
have
you,
monseigneur,
to
demand
an
account
of
my
attachments
and
friendships?
He
is
a
man
who
has
been
more
than
a
father
to
me!"
The
prince
was
about
to
say
something,
but
Helene
interrupted
him.
"Well,
yes,"
said
she,
"it
may
be
that
he
has
other
sentiments
for
me
than
those
of
a
father,
but
that
is
not
a
reason
for
me
to
shut
my
door
on
him.
I
am
not
a
man,
that
I
should
repay
kindness
with
ingratitude!
Know,
monseigneur,
that
in
all
that
relates
to
my
intimate
feelings
I
render
account
only
to
God
and
to
my
conscience,"
she
concluded,
laying
her
hand
on
her
beautiful,
fully
expanded
bosom
and
looking
up
to
heaven.
"But
for
heaven's
sake
listen
to
me!"
"Marry
me,
and
I
will
be
your
slave!"
"But
that's
impossible."
"You
won't
deign
to
demean
yourself
by
marrying
me,
you..."
said
Helene,
beginning
to
cry.
The
prince
tried
to
comfort
her,
but
Helene,
as
if
quite
distraught,
said
through
her
tears
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
her
marrying,
that
there
were
precedents
(there
were
up
to
that
time
very
few,
but
she
mentioned
Napoleon
and
some
other
exalted
personages),
that
she
had
never
been
her
husband's
wife,
and
that
she
had
been
sacrificed.
"But
the
law,
religion..."
said
the
prince,
already
yielding.
"The
law,
religion...
What
have
they
been
invented
for
if
they
can't
arrange
that?"
said
Helene.
The
prince
was
surprised
that
so
simple
an
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him,
and
he
applied
for
advice
to
the
holy
brethren
of
the
Society
of
Jesus,
with
whom
he
was
on
intimate
terms.
A
few
days
later
at
one
of
those
enchanting
fetes
which
Helene
gave
at
her
country
house
on
the
Stone
Island,
the
charming
Monsieur
de
Jobert,
a
man
no
longer
young,
with
snow
white
hair
and
brilliant
black
eyes,
a
Jesuit
a
robe
courte
*
was
presented
to
her,
and
in
the
garden
by
the
light
of
the
illuminations
and
to
the
sound
of
music
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
of
the
love
of
God,
of
Christ,
of
the
Sacred
Heart,
and
of
the
consolations
the
one
true
Catholic
religion
affords
in
this
world
and
the
next.
Helene
was
touched,
and
more
than
once
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
and
to
those
of
Monsieur
de
Jobert
and
their
voices
trembled.
A
dance,
for
which
her
partner
came
to
seek
her,
put
an
end
to
her
discourse
with
her
future
directeur
de
conscience,
but
the
next
evening
Monsieur
de
Jobert
came
to
see
Helene
when
she
was
alone,
and
after
that
often
came
again.
*
Lay
member
of
the
Society
of
Jesus.
One
day
he
took
the
countess
to
a
Roman
Catholic
church,
where
she
knelt
down
before
the
altar
to
which
she
was
led.
The
enchanting,
middle-aged
Frenchman
laid
his
hands
on
her
head
and,
as
she
herself
afterward
described
it,
she
felt
something
like
a
fresh
breeze
wafted
into
her
soul.
It
was
explained
to
her
that
this
was
la
grace.
After
that
a
long-frocked
abbe
was
brought
to
her.
She
confessed
to
him,
and
he
absolved
her
from
her
sins.
Next
day
she
received
a
box
containing
the
Sacred
Host,
which
was
left
at
her
house
for
her
to
partake
of.
A
few
days
later
Helene
learned
with
pleasure
that
she
had
now
been
admitted
to
the
true
Catholic
Church
and
that
in
a
few
days
the
Pope
himself
would
hear
of
her
and
would
send
her
a
certain
document.
All
that
was
done
around
her
and
to
her
at
this
time,
all
the
attention
devoted
to
her
by
so
many
clever
men
and
expressed
in
such
pleasant,
refined
ways,
and
the
state
of
dove-like
purity
she
was
now
in
(she
wore
only
white
dresses
and
white
ribbons
all
that
time)
gave
her
pleasure,
but
her
pleasure
did
not
cause
her
for
a
moment
to
forget
her
aim.
And
as
it
always
happens
in
contests
of
cunning
that
a
stupid
person
gets
the
better
of
cleverer
ones,
Helene--having
realized
that
the
main
object
of
all
these
words
and
all
this
trouble
was,
after
converting
her
to
Catholicism,
to
obtain
money
from
her
for
Jesuit
institutions
(as
to
which
she
received
indications)-before
parting
with
her
money
insisted
that
the
various
operations
necessary
to
free
her
from
her
husband
should
be
performed.
In
her
view
the
aim
of
every
religion
was
merely
to
preserve
certain
proprieties
while
affording
satisfaction
to
human
desires.
And
with
this
aim,
in
one
of
her
talks
with
her
Father
Confessor,
she
insisted
on
an
answer
to
the
question,
in
how
far
was
she
bound
by
her
marriage?
They
were
sitting
in
the
twilight
by
a
window
in
the
drawing
room.
The
scent
of
flowers
came
in
at
the
window.
Helene
was
wearing
a
white
dress,
transparent
over
her
shoulders
and
bosom.
The
abbe,
a
well-fed
man
with
a
plump,
clean-shaven
chin,
a
pleasant
firm
mouth,
and
white
hands
meekly
folded
on
his
knees,
sat
close
to
Helene
and,
with
a
subtle
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
peaceful
look
of
delight
at
her
beauty,
occasionally
glanced
at
her
face
as
he
explained
his
opinion
on
the
subject.
Helene
with
an
uneasy
smile
looked
at
his
curly
hair
and
his
plump,
clean-shaven,
blackish
cheeks
and
every
moment
expected
the
conversation
to
take
a
fresh
turn.
But
the
abbe,
though
he
evidently
enjoyed
the
beauty
of
his
companion,
was
absorbed
in
his
mastery
of
the
matter.
The
course
of
the
Father
Confessor's
arguments
ran
as
follows:
"Ignorant
of
the
import
of
what
you
were
undertaking,
you
made
a
vow
of
conjugal
fidelity
to
a
man
who
on
his
part,
by
entering
the
married
state
without
faith
in
the
religious
significance
of
marriage,
committed
an
act
of
sacrilege.
That
marriage
lacked
the
dual
significance
it
should
have
had.
Yet
in
spite
of
this
your
vow
was
binding.
You
swerved
from
it.
What
did
you
commit
by
so
acting?
A
venial,
or
a
mortal,
sin?
A
venial
sin,
for
you
acted
without
evil
intention.
If
now
you
married
again
with
the
object
of
bearing
children,
your
sin
might
be
forgiven.
But
the
question
is
again
a
twofold
one:
firstly..."
But
suddenly
Helene,
who
was
getting
bored,
said
with
one
of
her
bewitching
smiles:
"But
I
think
that
having
espoused
the
true
religion
I
cannot
be
bound
by
what
a
false
religion
laid
upon
me."
The
director
of
her
conscience
was
astounded
at
having
the
case
presented
to
him
thus
with
the
simplicity
of
Columbus'
egg.
He
was
delighted
at
the
unexpected
rapidity
of
his
pupil's
progress,
but
could
not
abandon
the
edifice
of
argument
he
had
laboriously
constructed.
"Let
us
understand
one
another,
Countess,"
said
he
with
a
smile,
and
began
refuting
his
spiritual
daughter's
arguments.
CHAPTER
VII
Helene
understood
that
the
question
was
very
simple
and
easy
from
the
ecclesiastical
point
of
view,
and
that
her
directors
were
making
difficulties
only
because
they
were
apprehensive
as
to
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
by
the
secular
authorities.
So
she
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
prepare
the
opinion
of
society.
She
provoked
the
jealousy
of
the
elderly
magnate
and
told
him
what
she
had
told
her
other
suitor;
that
is,
she
put
the
matter
so
that
the
only
way
for
him
to
obtain
a
right
over
her
was
to
marry
her.
The
elderly
magnate
was
at
first
as
much
taken
aback
by
this
suggestion
of
marriage
with
a
woman
whose
husband
was
alive,
as
the
younger
man
had
been,
but
Helene's
imperturbable
conviction
that
it
was
as
simple
and
natural
as
marrying
a
maiden
had
its
effect
on
him
too.
Had
Helene
herself
shown
the
least
sign
of
hesitation,
shame,
or
secrecy,
her
cause
would
certainly
have
been
lost;
but
not
only
did
she
show
no
signs
of
secrecy
or
shame,
on
the
contrary,
with
good-natured
naivete
she
told
her
intimate
friends
(and
these
were
all
Petersburg)
that
both
the
prince
and
the
magnate
had
proposed
to
her
and
that
she
loved
both
and
was
afraid
of
grieving
either.
A
rumor
immediately
spread
in
Petersburg,
not
that
Helene
wanted
to
be
divorced
from
her
husband
(had
such
a
report
spread
many
would
have
opposed
so
illegal
an
intention)
but
simply
that
the
unfortunate
and
interesting
Helene
was
in
doubt
which
of
the
two
men
she
should
marry.
The
question
was
no
longer
whether
this
was
possible,
but
only
which
was
the
better
match
and
how
the
matter
would
be
regarded
at
court.
There
were,
it
is
true,
some
rigid
individuals
unable
to
rise
to
the
height
of
such
a
question,
who
saw
in
the
project
a
desecration
of
the
sacrament
of
marriage,
but
there
were
not
many
such
and
they
remained
silent,
while
the
majority
were
interested
in
Helene's
good
fortune
and
in
the
question
which
match
would
be
the
more
advantageous.
Whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
remarry
while
one
had
a
husband
living
they
did
not
discuss,
for
that
question
had
evidently
been
settled
by
people
"wiser
than
you
or
me,"
as
they
said,
and
to
doubt
the
correctness
of
that
decision
would
be
to
risk
exposing
one's
stupidity
and
incapacity
to
live
in
society.
Only
Marya
Dmitrievna
Akhrosimova,
who
had
come
to
Petersburg
that
summer
to
see
one
of
her
sons,
allowed
herself
plainly
to
express
an
opinion
contrary
to
the
general
one.
Meeting
Helene
at
a
ball
she
stopped
her
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and,
amid
general
silence,
said
in
her
gruff
voice:
"So
wives
of
living
men
have
started
marrying
again!
Perhaps
you
think
you
have
invented
a
novelty?
You
have
been
forestalled,
my
dear!
It
was
thought
of
long
ago.
It
is
done
in
all
the
brothels,"
and
with
these
words
Marya
Dmitrievna,
turning
up
her
wide
sleeves
with
her
usual
threatening
gesture
and
glancing
sternly
round,
moved
across
the
room.
Though
people
were
afraid
of
Marya
Dmitrievna
she
was
regarded
in
Petersburg
as
a
buffoon,
and
so
of
what
she
had
said
they
only
noticed,
and
repeated
in
a
whisper,
the
one
coarse
word
she
had
used,
supposing
the
whole
sting
of
her
remark
to
lie
in
that
word.
Prince
Vasili,
who
of
late
very
often
forgot
what
he
had
said
and
repeated
one
and
the
same
thing
a
hundred
times,
remarked
to
his
daughter
whenever
he
chanced
to
see
her:
"Helene,
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you,"
and
he
would
lead
her
aside,
drawing
her
hand
downward.
"I
have
heard
of
certain
projects
concerning...
you
know.
Well
my
dear
child,
you
know
how
your
father's
heart
rejoices
to
know
that
you...
You
have
suffered
so
much....
But,
my
dear
child,
consult
only
your
own
heart.
That
is
all
I
have
to
say,"
and
concealing
his
unvarying
emotion
he
would
press
his
cheek
against
his
daughter's
and
move
away.
Bilibin,
who
had
not
lost
his
reputation
of
an
exceedingly
clever
man,
and
who
was
one
of
the
disinterested
friends
so
brilliant
a
woman
as
Helene
always
has--men
friends
who
can
never
change
into
lovers--once
gave
her
his
view
of
the
matter
at
a
small
and
intimate
gathering.
"Listen,
Bilibin,"
said
Helene
(she
always
called
friends
of
that
sort
by
their
surnames),
and
she
touched
his
coat
sleeve
with
her
white,
beringed
fingers.
"Tell
me,
as
you
would
a
sister,
what
I
ought
to
do.
Which
of
the
two?"
Bilibin
wrinkled
up
the
skin
over
his
eyebrows
and
pondered,
with
a
smile
on
his
lips.
"You
are
not
taking
me
unawares,
you
know,"
said
he.
"As
a
true
friend,
I
have
thought
and
thought
again
about
your
affair.
You
see,
if
you
marry
the
prince"--he
meant
the
younger
man--and
he
crooked
one
finger,
"you
forever
lose
the
chance
of
marrying
the
other,
and
you
will
displease
the
court
besides.
(You
know
there
is
some
kind
of
connection.)
But
if
you
marry
the
old
count
you
will
make
his
last
days
happy,
and
as
widow
of
the
Grand...
the
prince
would
no
longer
be
making
a
mesalliance
by
marrying
you,"
and
Bilibin
smoothed
out
his
forehead.
"That's
a
true
friend!"
said
Helene
beaming,
and
again
touching
Bilibin's
sleeve.
"But
I
love
them,
you
know,
and
don't
want
to
distress
either
of
them.
I
would
give
my
life
for
the
happiness
of
them
both."
Bilibin
shrugged
his
shoulders,
as
much
as
to
say
that
not
even
he
could
help
in
that
difficulty.
"Une
maitresse-femme!
*
That's
what
is
called
putting
things
squarely.
She
would
like
to
be
married
to
all
three
at
the
same
time,"
thought
he.
*
A
masterly
woman.
"But
tell
me,
how
will
your
husband
look
at
the
matter?"
Bilibin
asked,
his
reputation
being
so
well
established
that
he
did
not
fear
to
ask
so
naive
a
question.
"Will
he
agree?"
"Oh,
he
loves
me
so!"
said
Helene,
who
for
some
reason
imagined
that
Pierre
too
loved
her.
"He
will
do
anything
for
me."
Bilibin
puckered
his
skin
in
preparation
for
something
witty.
"Even
divorce
you?"
said
he.
Helene
laughed.
Among
those
who
ventured
to
doubt
the
justifiability
of
the
proposed
marriage
was
Helene's
mother,
Princess
Kuragina.
She
was
continually
tormented
by
jealousy
of
her
daughter,
and
now
that
jealousy
concerned
a
subject
near
to
her
own
heart,
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
idea.
She
consulted
a
Russian
priest
as
to
the
possibility
of
divorce
and
remarriage
during
a
husband's
lifetime,
and
the
priest
told
her
that
it
was
impossible,
and
to
her
delight
showed
her
a
text
in
the
Gospel
which
(as
it
seemed
to
him)
plainly
forbids
remarriage
while
the
husband
is
alive.
Armed
with
these
arguments,
which
appeared
to
her
unanswerable,
she
drove
to
her
daughter's
early
one
morning
so
as
to
find
her
alone.
Having
listened
to
her
mother's
objections,
Helene
smiled
blandly
and
ironically.
"But
it
says
plainly:
'Whosoever
shall
marry
her
that
is
divorced...'"
said
the
old
princess.
"Ah,
Maman,
ne
dites
pas
de
betises.
Vous
ne
comprenez
rien.
Dans
ma
position
j'ai
des
devoirs,"
*
said
Helene
changing
from
Russian,
in
which
language
she
always
felt
that
her
case
did
not
sound
quite
clear,
into
French
which
suited
it
better.
*
"Oh,
Mamma,
don't
talk
nonsense!
You
don't
understand
anything.
In
my
position
I
have
obligations."
"But,
my
dear...."
"Oh,
Mamma,
how
is
it
you
don't
understand
that
the
Holy
Father,
who
has
the
right
to
grant
dispensations..."
Just
then
the
lady
companion
who
lived
with
Helene
came
in
to
announce
that
His
Highness
was
in
the
ballroom
and
wished
to
see
her.
"Non,
dites-lui
que
je
ne
veux
pas
le
voir,
que
je
suis
furieuse
contre
lui,
parce
qu'il
m'a
manque
parole."
*
*
"No,
tell
him
I
don't
wish
to
see
him,
I
am
furious
with
him
for
not
keeping
his
word
to
me."
"Comtesse,
a
tout
peche
misericorde,"
*
said
a
fair-haired
young
man
with
a
long
face
and
nose,
as
he
entered
the
room.
*
"Countess,
there
is
mercy
for
every
sin."
The
old
princess
rose
respectfully
and
curtsied.
The
young
man
who
had
entered
took
no
notice
of
her.
The
princess
nodded
to
her
daughter
and
sidled
out
of
the
room.
"Yes,
she
is
right,"
thought
the
old
princess,
all
her
convictions
dissipated
by
the
appearance
of
His
Highness.
"She
is
right,
but
how
is
it
that
we
in
our
irrecoverable
youth
did
not
know
it?
Yet
it
is
so
simple,"
she
thought
as
she
got
into
her
carriage.
By
the
beginning
of
August
Helene's
affairs
were
clearly
defined
and
she
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband--who,
as
she
imagined,
loved
her
very
much--informing
him
of
her
intention
to
marry
N.N.
and
of
her
having
embraced
the
one
true
faith,
and
asking
him
to
carry
out
all
the
formalities
necessary
for
a
divorce,
which
would
be
explained
to
him
by
the
bearer
of
the
letter.
And
so
I
pray
God
to
have
you,
my
friend,
in
His
holy
and
powerful
keeping--Your
friend
Helene.
This
letter
was
brought
to
Pierre's
house
when
he
was
on
the
field
of
Borodino.
CHAPTER
VIII
Toward
the
end
of
the
battle
of
Borodino,
Pierre,
having
run
down
from
Raevski's
battery
a
second
time,
made
his
way
through
a
gully
to
Knyazkovo
with
a
crowd
of
soldiers,
reached
the
dressing
station,
and
seeing
blood
and
hearing
cries
and
groans
hurried
on,
still
entangled
in
the
crowds
of
soldiers.
The
one
thing
he
now
desired
with
his
whole
soul
was
to
get
away
quickly
from
the
terrible
sensations
amid
which
he
had
lived
that
day
and
return
to
ordinary
conditions
of
life
and
sleep
quietly
in
a
room
in
his
own
bed.
He
felt
that
only
in
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
would
he
be
able
to
understand
himself
and
all
he
had
seen
and
felt.
But
such
ordinary
conditions
of
life
were
nowhere
to
be
found.
Though
shells
and
bullets
did
not
whistle
over
the
road
along
which
he
was
going,
still
on
all
sides
there
was
what
there
had
been
on
the
field
of
battle.
There
were
still
the
same
suffering,
exhausted,
and
sometimes
strangely
indifferent
faces,
the
same
blood,
the
same
soldiers'
overcoats,
the
same
sounds
of
firing
which,
though
distant
now,
still
aroused
terror,
and
besides
this
there
were
the
foul
air
and
the
dust.
Having
gone
a
couple
of
miles
along
the
Mozhaysk
road,
Pierre
sat
down
by
the
roadside.
Dusk
had
fallen,
and
the
roar
of
guns
died
away.
Pierre
lay
leaning
on
his
elbow
for
a
long
time,
gazing
at
the
shadows
that
moved
past
him
in
the
darkness.
He
was
continually
imagining
that
a
cannon
ball
was
flying
toward
him
with
a
terrific
whizz,
and
then
he
shuddered
and
sat
up.
He
had
no
idea
how
long
he
had
been
there.
In
the
middle
of
the
night
three
soldiers,
having
brought
some
firewood,
settled
down
near
him
and
began
lighting
a
fire.
The
soldiers,
who
threw
sidelong
glances
at
Pierre,
got
the
fire
to
burn
and
placed
an
iron
pot
on
it
into
which
they
broke
some
dried
bread
and
put
a
little
dripping.
The
pleasant
odor
of
greasy
viands
mingled
with
the
smell
of
smoke.
Pierre
sat
up
and
sighed.
The
three
soldiers
were
eating
and
talking
among
themselves,
taking
no
notice
of
him.
"And
who
may
you
be?"
one
of
them
suddenly
asked
Pierre,
evidently
meaning
what
Pierre
himself
had
in
mind,
namely:
"If
you
want
to
eat
we'll
give
you
some
food,
only
let
us
know
whether
you
are
an
honest
man."
"I,
I..."
said
Pierre,
feeling
it
necessary
to
minimize
his
social
position
as
much
as
possible
so
as
to
be
nearer
to
the
soldiers
and
better
understood
by
them.
"By
rights
I
am
a
militia
officer,
but
my
men
are
not
here.
I
came
to
the
battle
and
have
lost
them."
"There
now!"
said
one
of
the
soldiers.
Another
shook
his
head.
"Would
you
like
a
little
mash?"
the
first
soldier
asked,
and
handed
Pierre
a
wooden
spoon
after
licking
it
clean.
Pierre
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
began
eating
the
mash,
as
they
called
the
food
in
the
cauldron,
and
he
thought
it
more
delicious
than
any
food
he
had
ever
tasted.
As
he
sat
bending
greedily
over
it,
helping
himself
to
large
spoonfuls
and
chewing
one
after
another,
his
face
was
lit
up
by
the
fire
and
the
soldiers
looked
at
him
in
silence.
"Where
have
you
to
go
to?
Tell
us!"
said
one
of
them.
"To
Mozhaysk."
"You're
a
gentleman,
aren't
you?"
"Yes."
"And
what's
your
name?"
"Peter
Kirilych."
"Well
then,
Peter
Kirilych,
come
along
with
us,
we'll
take
you
there."
In
the
total
darkness
the
soldiers
walked
with
Pierre
to
Mozhaysk.
By
the
time
they
got
near
Mozhaysk
and
began
ascending
the
steep
hill
into
the
town,
the
cocks
were
already
crowing.
Pierre
went
on
with
the
soldiers,
quite
forgetting
that
his
inn
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
that
he
had
already
passed
it.
He
would
not
soon
have
remembered
this,
such
was
his
state
of
forgetfulness,
had
he
not
halfway
up
the
hill
stumbled
upon
his
groom,
who
had
been
to
look
for
him
in
the
town
and
was
returning
to
the
inn.
The
groom
recognized
Pierre
in
the
darkness
by
his
white
hat.
"Your
excellency!"
he
said.
"Why,
we
were
beginning
to
despair!
How
is
it
you
are
on
foot?
And
where
are
you
going,
please?"
"Oh,
yes!"
said
Pierre.
The
soldiers
stopped.
"So
you've
found
your
folk?"
said
one
of
them.
"Well,
good-by,
Peter
Kirilych--isn't
it?"
"Good-bye,
Peter
Kirilych!"
Pierre
heard
the
other
voices
repeat.
"Good-bye!"
he
said
and
turned
with
his
groom
toward
the
inn.
"I
ought
to
give
them
something!"
he
thought,
and
felt
in
his
pocket.
"No,
better
not!"
said
another,
inner
voice.
There
was
not
a
room
to
be
had
at
the
inn,
they
were
all
occupied.
Pierre
went
out
into
the
yard
and,
covering
himself
up
head
and
all,
lay
down
in
his
carriage.
CHAPTER
IX
Scarcely
had
Pierre
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
before
he
felt
himself
falling
asleep,
but
suddenly,
almost
with
the
distinctness
of
reality,
he
heard
the
boom,
boom,
boom
of
firing,
the
thud
of
projectiles,
groans
and
cries,
and
smelled
blood
and
powder,
and
a
feeling
of
horror
and
dread
of
death
seized
him.
Filled
with
fright
he
opened
his
eyes
and
lifted
his
head
from
under
his
cloak.
All
was
tranquil
in
the
yard.
Only
someone's
orderly
passed
through
the
gateway,
splashing
through
the
mud,
and
talked
to
the
innkeeper.
Above
Pierre's
head
some
pigeons,
disturbed
by
the
movement
he
had
made
in
sitting
up,
fluttered
under
the
dark
roof
of
the
penthouse.
The
whole
courtyard
was
permeated
by
a
strong
peaceful
smell
of
stable
yards,
delightful
to
Pierre
at
that
moment.
He
could
see
the
clear
starry
sky
between
the
dark
roofs
of
two
penthouses.
"Thank
God,
there
is
no
more
of
that!"
he
thought,
covering
up
his
head
again.
"Oh,
what
a
terrible
thing
is
fear,
and
how
shamefully
I
yielded
to
it!
But
they...
they
were
steady
and
calm
all
the
time,
to
the
end..."
thought
he.
They,
in
Pierre's
mind,
were
the
soldiers,
those
who
had
been
at
the
battery,
those
who
had
given
him
food,
and
those
who
had
prayed
before
the
icon.
They,
those
strange
men
he
had
not
previously
known,
stood
out
clearly
and
sharply
from
everyone
else.
"To
be
a
soldier,
just
a
soldier!"
thought
Pierre
as
he
fell
asleep,
"to
enter
communal
life
completely,
to
be
imbued
by
what
makes
them
what
they
are.
But
how
cast
off
all
the
superfluous,
devilish
burden
of
my
outer
man?
There
was
a
time
when
I
could
have
done
it.
I
could
have
run
away
from
my
father,
as
I
wanted
to.
Or
I
might
have
been
sent
to
serve
as
a
soldier
after
the
duel
with
Dolokhov."
And
the
memory
of
the
dinner
at
the
English
Club
when
he
had
challenged
Dolokhov
flashed
through
Pierre's
mind,
and
then
he
remembered
his
benefactor
at
Torzhok.
And
now
a
picture
of
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
lodge
presented
itself
to
his
mind.
It
was
taking
place
at
the
English
Club
and
someone
near
and
dear
to
him
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table.
"Yes,
that
is
he!
It
is
my
benefactor.
But
he
died!"
thought
Pierre.
"Yes,
he
died,
and
I
did
not
know
he
was
alive.
How
sorry
I
am
that
he
died,
and
how
glad
I
am
that
he
is
alive
again!"
On
one
side
of
the
table
sat
Anatole,
Dolokhov,
Nesvitski,
Denisov,
and
others
like
them
(in
his
dream
the
category
to
which
these
men
belonged
was
as
clearly
defined
in
his
mind
as
the
category
of
those
he
termed
they),
and
he
heard
those
people,
Anatole
and
Dolokhov,
shouting
and
singing
loudly;
yet
through
their
shouting
the
voice
of
his
benefactor
was
heard
speaking
all
the
time
and
the
sound
of
his
words
was
as
weighty
and
uninterrupted
as
the
booming
on
the
battlefield,
but
pleasant
and
comforting.
Pierre
did
not
understand
what
his
benefactor
was
saying,
but
he
knew
(the
categories
of
thoughts
were
also
quite
distinct
in
his
dream)
that
he
was
talking
of
goodness
and
the
possibility
of
being
what
they
were.
And
they
with
their
simple,
kind,
firm
faces
surrounded
his
benefactor
on
all
sides.
But
though
they
were
kindly
they
did
not
look
at
Pierre
and
did
not
know
him.
Wishing
to
speak
and
to
attract
their
attention,
he
got
up,
but
at
that
moment
his
legs
grew
cold
and
bare.
He
felt
ashamed,
and
with
one
arm
covered
his
legs
from
which
his
cloak
had
in
fact
slipped.
For
a
moment
as
he
was
rearranging
his
cloak
Pierre
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
penthouse
roofs,
posts,
and
yard,
but
now
they
were
all
bluish,
lit
up,
and
glittering
with
frost
or
dew.
"It
is
dawn,"
thought
Pierre.
"But
that's
not
what
I
want.
I
want
to
hear
and
understand
my
benefactor's
words."
Again
he
covered
himself
up
with
his
cloak,
but
now
neither
the
lodge
nor
his
benefactor
was
there.
There
were
only
thoughts
clearly
expressed
in
words,
thoughts
that
someone
was
uttering
or
that
he
himself
was
formulating.
Afterwards
when
he
recalled
those
thoughts
Pierre
was
convinced
that
someone
outside
himself
had
spoken
them,
though
the
impressions
of
that
day
had
evoked
them.
He
had
never,
it
seemed
to
him,
been
able
to
think
and
express
his
thoughts
like
that
when
awake.
"To
endure
war
is
the
most
difficult
subordination
of
man's
freedom
to
the
law
of
God,"
the
voice
had
said.
"Simplicity
is
submission
to
the
will
of
God;
you
cannot
escape
from
Him.
And
they
are
simple.
They
do
not
talk,
but
act.
The
spoken
word
is
silver
but
the
unspoken
is
golden.
Man
can
be
master
of
nothing
while
he
fears
death,
but
he
who
does
not
fear
it
possesses
all.
If
there
were
no
suffering,
man
would
not
know
his
limitations,
would
not
know
himself.
The
hardest
thing
(Pierre
went
on
thinking,
or
hearing,
in
his
dream)
is
to
be
able
in
your
soul
to
unite
the
meaning
of
all.
To
unite
all?"
he
asked
himself.
"No,
not
to
unite.
Thoughts
cannot
be
united,
but
to
harness
all
these
thoughts
together
is
what
we
need!
Yes,
one
must
harness
them,
must
harness
them!"
he
repeated
to
himself
with
inward
rapture,
feeling
that
these
words
and
they
alone
expressed
what
he
wanted
to
say
and
solved
the
question
that
tormented
him.
"Yes,
one
must
harness,
it
is
time
to
harness."
"Time
to
harness,
time
to
harness,
your
excellency!
Your
excellency!"
some
voice
was
repeating.
"We
must
harness,
it
is
time
to
harness...."
It
was
the
voice
of
the
groom,
trying
to
wake
him.
The
sun
shone
straight
into
Pierre's
face.
He
glanced
at
the
dirty
innyard
in
the
middle
of
which
soldiers
were
watering
their
lean
horses
at
the
pump
while
carts
were
passing
out
of
the
gate.
Pierre
turned
away
with
repugnance,
and
closing
his
eyes
quickly
fell
back
on
the
carriage
seat.
"No,
I
don't
want
that,
I
don't
want
to
see
and
understand
that.
I
want
to
understand
what
was
revealing
itself
to
me
in
my
dream.
One
second
more
and
I
should
have
understood
it
all!
But
what
am
I
to
do?
Harness,
but
how
can
I
harness
everything?"
and
Pierre
felt
with
horror
that
the
meaning
of
all
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
the
dream
had
been
destroyed.
The
groom,
the
coachman,
and
the
innkeeper
told
Pierre
that
an
officer
had
come
with
news
that
the
French
were
already
near
Mozhaysk
and
that
our
men
were
leaving
it.
Pierre
got
up
and,
having
told
them
to
harness
and
overtake
him,
went
on
foot
through
the
town.
The
troops
were
moving
on,
leaving
about
ten
thousand
wounded
behind
them.
There
were
wounded
in
the
yards,
at
the
windows
of
the
houses,
and
the
streets
were
crowded
with
them.
In
the
streets,
around
carts
that
were
to
take
some
of
the
wounded
away,
shouts,
curses,
and
blows
could
be
heard.
Pierre
offered
the
use
of
his
carriage,
which
had
overtaken
him,
to
a
wounded
general
he
knew,
and
drove
with
him
to
Moscow.
On
the
way
Pierre
was
told
of
the
death
of
his
brother-in-law
Anatole
and
of
that
of
Prince
Andrew.
CHAPTER
X
On
the
thirteenth
of
August
Pierre
reached
Moscow.
Close
to
the
gates
of
the
city
he
was
met
by
Count
Rostopchin's
adjutant.
"We
have
been
looking
for
you
everywhere,"
said
the
adjutant.
"The
count
wants
to
see
you
particularly.
He
asks
you
to
come
to
him
at
once
on
a
very
important
matter."
Without
going
home,
Pierre
took
a
cab
and
drove
to
see
the
Moscow
commander-in-chief.
Count
Rostopchin
had
only
that
morning
returned
to
town
from
his
summer
villa
at
Sokolniki.
The
anteroom
and
reception
room
of
his
house
were
full
of
officials
who
had
been
summoned
or
had
come
for
orders.
Vasilchikov
and
Platov
had
already
seen
the
count
and
explained
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
to
defend
Moscow
and
that
it
would
have
to
be
surrendered.
Though
this
news
was
being
concealed
from
the
inhabitants,
the
officials--the
heads
of
the
various
government
departments--knew
that
Moscow
would
soon
be
in
the
enemy's
hands,
just
as
Count
Rostopchin
himself
knew
it,
and
to
escape
personal
responsibility
they
had
all
come
to
the
governor
to
ask
how
they
were
to
deal
with
their
various
departments.
As
Pierre
was
entering
the
reception
room
a
courier
from
the
army
came
out
of
Rostopchin's
private
room.
In
answer
to
questions
with
which
he
was
greeted,
the
courier
made
a
despairing
gesture
with
his
hand
and
passed
through
the
room.
While
waiting
in
the
reception
room
Pierre
with
weary
eyes
watched
the
various
officials,
old
and
young,
military
and
civilian,
who
were
there.
They
all
seemed
dissatisfied
and
uneasy.
Pierre
went
up
to
a
group
of
men,
one
of
whom
he
knew.
After
greeting
Pierre
they
continued
their
conversation.
"If
they're
sent
out
and
brought
back
again
later
on
it
will
do
no
harm,
but
as
things
are
now
one
can't
answer
for
anything."
"But
you
see
what
he
writes..."
said
another,
pointing
to
a
printed
sheet
he
held
in
his
hand.
"That's
another
matter.
That's
necessary
for
the
people,"
said
the
first.
"What
is
it?"
asked
Pierre.
"Oh,
it's
a
fresh
broadsheet."
Pierre
took
it
and
began
reading.
His
Serene
Highness
has
passed
through
Mozhaysk
in
order
to
join
up
with
the
troops
moving
toward
him
and
has
taken
up
a
strong
position
where
the
enemy
will
not
soon
attack
him.
Forty
eight
guns
with
ammunition
have
been
sent
him
from
here,
and
his
Serene
Highness
says
he
will
defend
Moscow
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
and
is
even
ready
to
fight
in
the
streets.
Do
not
be
upset,
brothers,
that
the
law
courts
are
closed;
things
have
to
be
put
in
order,
and
we
will
deal
with
villains
in
our
own
way!
When
the
time
comes
I
shall
want
both
town
and
peasant
lads
and
will
raise
the
cry
a
day
or
two
beforehand,
but
they
are
not
wanted
yet
so
I
hold
my
peace.
An
ax
will
be
useful,
a
hunting
spear
not
bad,
but
a
three-pronged
fork
will
be
best
of
all:
a
Frenchman
is
no
heavier
than
a
sheaf
of
rye.
Tomorrow
after
dinner
I
shall
take
the
Iberian
icon
of
the
Mother
of
God
to
the
wounded
in
the
Catherine
Hospital
where
we
will
have
some
water
blessed.
That
will
help
them
to
get
well
quicker.
I,
too,
am
well
now:
one
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
I
am
on
the
lookout
with
both.
"But
military
men
have
told
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
fight
in
the
town,"
said
Pierre,
"and
that
the
position..."
"Well,
of
course!
That's
what
we
were
saying,"
replied
the
first
speaker.
"And
what
does
he
mean
by
'One
of
my
eyes
was
sore
but
now
I
am
on
the
lookout
with
both'?"
asked
Pierre.
"The
count
had
a
sty,"
replied
the
adjutant
smiling,
"and
was
very
much
upset
when
I
told
him
people
had
come
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
with
him.
By
the
by,
Count,"
he
added
suddenly,
addressing
Pierre
with
a
smile,
"we
heard
that
you
have
family
troubles
and
that
the
countess,
your
wife..."
"I
have
heard
nothing,"
Pierre
replied
unconcernedly.
"But
what
have
you
heard?"
"Oh,
well,
you
know
people
often
invent
things.
I
only
say
what
I
heard."
"But
what
did
you
hear?"
"Well,
they
say,"
continued
the
adjutant
with
the
same
smile,
"that
the
countess,
your
wife,
is
preparing
to
go
abroad.
I
expect
it's
nonsense...."
"Possibly,"
remarked
Pierre,
looking
about
him
absent-mindedly.
"And
who
is
that?"
he
asked,
indicating
a
short
old
man
in
a
clean
blue
peasant
overcoat,
with
a
big
snow-white
beard
and
eyebrows
and
a
ruddy
face.
"He?
That's
a
tradesman,
that
is
to
say,
he's
the
restaurant
keeper,
Vereshchagin.
Perhaps
you
have
heard
of
that
affair
with
the
proclamation."
"Oh,
so
that
is
Vereshchagin!"
said
Pierre,
looking
at
the
firm,
calm
face
of
the
old
man
and
seeking
any
indication
of
his
being
a
traitor.
"That's
not
he
himself,
that's
the
father
of
the
fellow
who
wrote
the
proclamation,"
said
the
adjutant.
"The
young
man
is
in
prison
and
I
expect
it
will
go
hard
with
him."
An
old
gentleman
wearing
a
star
and
another
official,
a
German
wearing
a
cross
round
his
neck,
approached
the
speaker.
"It's
a
complicated
story,
you
know,"
said
the
adjutant.
"That
proclamation
appeared
about
two
months
ago.
The
count
was
informed
of
it.
He
gave
orders
to
investigate
the
matter.
Gabriel
Ivanovich
here
made
the
inquiries.
The
proclamation
had
passed
through
exactly
sixty-
three
hands.
He
asked
one,
'From
whom
did
you
get
it?'
'From
so-and-so.'
He
went
to
the
next
one.
'From
whom
did
you
get
it?'
and
so
on
till
he
reached
Vereshchagin,
a
half
educated
tradesman,
you
know,
'a
pet
of
a
trader,'"
said
the
adjutant
smiling.
"They
asked
him,
'Who
gave
it
you?'
And
the
point
is
that
we
knew
whom
he
had
it
from.
He
could
only
have
had
it
from
the
Postmaster.
But
evidently
they
had
come
to
some
understanding.
He
replied:
'From
no
one;
I
made
it
up
myself.'
They
threatened
and
questioned
him,
but
he
stuck
to
that:
'I
made
it
up
myself.'
And
so
it
was
reported
to
the
count,
who
sent
for
the
man.
'From
whom
did
you
get
the
proclamation?'
'I
wrote
it
myself.'
Well,
you
know
the
count,"
said
the
adjutant
cheerfully,
with
a
smile
of
pride,
"he
flared
up
dreadfully--and
just
think
of
the
fellow's
audacity,
lying,
and
obstinacy!"
"And
the
count
wanted
him
to
say
it
was
from
Klyucharev?
I
understand!"
said
Pierre.
"Not
at
all,"
rejoined
the
adjutant
in
dismay.
"Klyucharev
had
his
own
sins
to
answer
for
without
that
and
that
is
why
he
has
been
banished.
But
the
point
is
that
the
count
was
much
annoyed.
'How
could
you
have
written
it
yourself?'
said
he,
and
he
took
up
the
Hamburg
Gazette
that
was
lying
on
the
table.
'Here
it
is!
You
did
not
write
it
yourself
but
translated
it,
and
translated
it
abominably,
because
you
don't
even
know
French,
you
fool.'
And
what
do
you
think?
'No,'
said
he,
'I
have
not
read
any
papers,
I
made
it
up
myself.'
'If
that's
so,
you're
a
traitor
and
I'll
have
you
tried,
and
you'll
be
hanged!
Say
from
whom
you
had
it.'
'I
have
seen
no
papers,
I
made
it
up
myself.'
And
that
was
the
end
of
it.
The
count
had
the
father
fetched,
but
the
fellow
stuck
to
it.
He
was
sent
for
trial
and
condemned
to
hard
labor,
I
believe.
Now
the
father
has
come
to
intercede
for
him.
But
he's
a
good-for-nothing
lad!
You
know
that
sort
of
tradesman's
son,
a
dandy
and
lady-killer.
He
attended
some
lectures
somewhere
and
imagines
that
the
devil
is
no
match
for
him.
That's
the
sort
of
fellow
he
is.
His
father
keeps
a
cookshop
here
by
the
Stone
Bridge,
and
you
know
there
was
a
large
icon
of
God
Almighty
painted
with
a
scepter
in
one
hand
and
an
orb
in
the
other.
Well,
he
took
that
icon
home
with
him
for
a
few
days
and
what
did
he
do?
He
found
some
scoundrel
of
a
painter..."
CHAPTER
XI
In
the
middle
of
this
fresh
tale
Pierre
was
summoned
to
the
commander
in
chief.
When
he
entered
the
private
room
Count
Rostopchin,
puckering
his
face,
was
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyes
with
his
hand.
A
short
man
was
saying
something,
but
when
Pierre
entered
he
stopped
speaking
and
went
out.
"Ah,
how
do
you
do,
great
warrior?"
said
Rostopchin
as
soon
as
the
short
man
had
left
the
room.
"We
have
heard
of
your
prowess.
But
that's
not
the
point.
Between
ourselves,
mon
cher,
do
you
belong
to
the
Masons?"
he
went
on
severely,
as
though
there
were
something
wrong
about
it
which
he
nevertheless
intended
to
pardon.
Pierre
remained
silent.
"I
am
well
informed,
my
friend,
but
I
am
aware
that
there
are
Masons
and
I
hope
that
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
on
pretense
of
saving
mankind
wish
to
ruin
Russia."
"Yes,
I
am
a
Mason,"
Pierre
replied.
"There,
you
see,
mon
cher!
I
expect
you
know
that
Messrs.
Speranski
and
Magnitski
have
been
deported
to
their
proper
place.
Mr.
Klyucharev
has
been
treated
in
the
same
way,
and
so
have
others
who
on
the
plea
of
building
up
the
temple
of
Solomon
have
tried
to
destroy
the
temple
of
their
fatherland.
You
can
understand
that
there
are
reasons
for
this
and
that
I
could
not
have
exiled
the
Postmaster
had
he
not
been
a
harmful
person.
It
has
now
come
to
my
knowledge
that
you
lent
him
your
carriage
for
his
removal
from
town,
and
that
you
have
even
accepted
papers
from
him
for
safe
custody.
I
like
you
and
don't
wish
you
any
harm
and--as
you
are
only
half
my
age--I
advise
you,
as
a
father
would,
to
cease
all
communication
with
men
of
that
stamp
and
to
leave
here
as
soon
as
possible."
"But
what
did
Klyucharev
do
wrong,
Count?"
asked
Pierre.
"That
is
for
me
to
know,
but
not
for
you
to
ask,"
shouted
Rostopchin.
"If
he
is
accused
of
circulating
Napoleon's
proclamation
it
is
not
proved
that
he
did
so,"
said
Pierre
without
looking
at
Rostopchin,
"and
Vereshchagin..."
"There
we
are!"
Rostopchin
shouted
at
Pierre
louder
than
before,
frowning
suddenly.
"Vereshchagin
is
a
renegade
and
a
traitor
who
will
be
punished
as
he
deserves,"
said
he
with
the
vindictive
heat
with
which
people
speak
when
recalling
an
insult.
"But
I
did
not
summon
you
to
discuss
my
actions,
but
to
give
you
advice--or
an
order
if
you
prefer
it.
I
beg
you
to
leave
the
town
and
break
off
all
communication
with
such
men
as
Klyucharev.
And
I
will
knock
the
nonsense
out
of
anybody"--
but
probably
realizing
that
he
was
shouting
at
Bezukhov
who
so
far
was
not
guilty
of
anything,
he
added,
taking
Pierre's
hand
in
a
friendly
manner,
"We
are
on
the
eve
of
a
public
disaster
and
I
haven't
time
to
be
polite
to
everybody
who
has
business
with
me.
My
head
is
sometimes
in
a
whirl.
Well,
mon
cher,
what
are
you
doing
personally?"
"Why,
nothing,"
answered
Pierre
without
raising
his
eyes
or
changing
the
thoughtful
expression
of
his
face.
The
count
frowned.
"A
word
of
friendly
advice,
mon
cher.
Be
off
as
soon
as
you
can,
that's
all
I
have
to
tell
you.
Happy
he
who
has
ears
to
hear.
Good-bye,
my
dear
fellow.
Oh,
by
the
by!"
he
shouted
through
the
doorway
after
Pierre,
"is
it
true
that
the
countess
has
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
the
holy
fathers
of
the
Society
of
Jesus?"
Pierre
did
not
answer
and
left
Rostopchin's
room
more
sullen
and
angry
than
he
had
ever
before
shown
himself.
When
he
reached
home
it
was
already
getting
dark.
Some
eight
people
had
come
to
see
him
that
evening:
the
secretary
of
a
committee,
the
colonel
of
his
battalion,
his
steward,
his
major-domo,
and
various
petitioners.
They
all
had
business
with
Pierre
and
wanted
decisions
from
him.
Pierre
did
not
understand
and
was
not
interested
in
any
of
these
questions
and
only
answered
them
in
order
to
get
rid
of
these
people.
When
left
alone
at
last
he
opened
and
read
his
wife's
letter.
"They,
the
soldiers
at
the
battery,
Prince
Andrew
killed...
that
old
man...
Simplicity
is
submission
to
God.
Suffering
is
necessary...
the
meaning
of
all...
one
must
harness...
my
wife
is
getting
married...
One
must
forget
and
understand..."
And
going
to
his
bed
he
threw
himself
on
it
without
undressing
and
immediately
fell
asleep.
When
he
awoke
next
morning
the
major-domo
came
to
inform
him
that
a
special
messenger,
a
police
officer,
had
come
from
Count
Rostopchin
to
know
whether
Count
Bezukhov
had
left
or
was
leaving
the
town.
A
dozen
persons
who
had
business
with
Pierre
were
awaiting
him
in
the
drawing
room.
Pierre
dressed
hurriedly
and,
instead
of
going
to
see
them,
went
to
the
back
porch
and
out
through
the
gate.
From
that
time
till
the
end
of
the
destruction
of
Moscow
no
one
of
Bezukhov's
household,
despite
all
the
search
they
made,
saw
Pierre
again
or
knew
where
he
was.
CHAPTER
XII
The
Rostovs
remained
in
Moscow
till
the
first
of
September,
that
is,
till
the
eve
of
the
enemy's
entry
into
the
city.
After
Petya
had
joined
Obolenski's
regiment
of
Cossacks
and
left
for
Belaya
Tserkov
where
that
regiment
was
forming,
the
countess
was
seized
with
terror.
The
thought
that
both
her
sons
were
at
the
war,
had
both
gone
from
under
her
wing,
that
today
or
tomorrow
either
or
both
of
them
might
be
killed
like
the
three
sons
of
one
of
her
acquaintances,
struck
her
that
summer
for
the
first
time
with
cruel
clearness.
She
tried
to
get
Nicholas
back
and
wished
to
go
herself
to
join
Petya,
or
to
get
him
an
appointment
somewhere
in
Petersburg,
but
neither
of
these
proved
possible.
Petya
could
not
return
unless
his
regiment
did
so
or
unless
he
was
transferred
to
another
regiment
on
active
service.
Nicholas
was
somewhere
with
the
army
and
had
not
sent
a
word
since
his
last
letter,
in
which
he
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
his
meeting
with
Princess
Mary.
The
countess
did
not
sleep
at
night,
or
when
she
did
fall
asleep
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
sons
lying
dead.
After
many
consultations
and
conversations,
the
count
at
last
devised
means
to
tranquillize
her.
He
got
Petya
transferred
from
Obolenski's
regiment
to
Bezukhov's,
which
was
in
training
near
Moscow.
Though
Petya
would
remain
in
the
service,
this
transfer
would
give
the
countess
the
consolation
of
seeing
at
least
one
of
her
sons
under
her
wing,
and
she
hoped
to
arrange
matters
for
her
Petya
so
as
not
to
let
him
go
again,
but
always
get
him
appointed
to
places
where
he
could
not
possibly
take
part
in
a
battle.
As
long
as
Nicholas
alone
was
in
danger
the
countess
imagined
that
she
loved
her
first-born
more
than
all
her
other
children
and
even
reproached
herself
for
it;
but
when
her
youngest:
the
scapegrace
who
had
been
bad
at
lessons,
was
always
breaking
things
in
the
house
and
making
himself
a
nuisance
to
everybody,
that
snub-nosed
Petya
with
his
merry
black
eyes
and
fresh
rosy
cheeks
where
soft
down
was
just
beginning
to
show--when
he
was
thrown
amid
those
big,
dreadful,
cruel
men
who
were
fighting
somewhere
about
something
and
apparently
finding
pleasure
in
it--then
his
mother
thought
she
loved
him
more,
much
more,
than
all
her
other
children.
The
nearer
the
time
came
for
Petya
to
return,
the
more
uneasy
grew
the
countess.
She
began
to
think
she
would
never
live
to
see
such
happiness.
The
presence
of
Sonya,
of
her
beloved
Natasha,
or
even
of
her
husband
irritated
her.
"What
do
I
want
with
them?
I
want
no
one
but
Petya,"
she
thought.
At
the
end
of
August
the
Rostovs
received
another
letter
from
Nicholas.
He
wrote
from
the
province
of
Voronezh
where
he
had
been
sent
to
procure
remounts,
but
that
letter
did
not
set
the
countess
at
ease.
Knowing
that
one
son
was
out
of
danger
she
became
the
more
anxious
about
Petya.
Though
by
the
twentieth
of
August
nearly
all
the
Rostovs'
acquaintances
had
left
Moscow,
and
though
everybody
tried
to
persuade
the
countess
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible,
she
would
not
hear
of
leaving
before
her
treasure,
her
adored
Petya,
returned.
On
the
twenty-eighth
of
August
he
arrived.
The
passionate
tenderness
with
which
his
mother
received
him
did
not
please
the
sixteen-year-old
officer.
Though
she
concealed
from
him
her
intention
of
keeping
him
under
her
wing,
Petya
guessed
her
designs,
and
instinctively
fearing
that
he
might
give
way
to
emotion
when
with
her--might
"become
womanish"
as
he
termed
it
to
himself--he
treated
her
coldly,
avoided
her,
and
during
his
stay
in
Moscow
attached
himself
exclusively
to
Natasha
for
whom
he
had
always
had
a
particularly
brotherly
tenderness,
almost
lover-like.
Owing
to
the
count's
customary
carelessness
nothing
was
ready
for
their
departure
by
the
twenty-eighth
of
August
and
the
carts
that
were
to
come
from
their
Ryazan
and
Moscow
estates
to
remove
their
household
belongings
did
not
arrive
till
the
thirtieth.
From
the
twenty-eighth
till
the
thirty-first
all
Moscow
was
in
a
bustle
and
commotion.
Every
day
thousands
of
men
wounded
at
Borodino
were
brought
in
by
the
Dorogomilov
gate
and
taken
to
various
parts
of
Moscow,
and
thousands
of
carts
conveyed
the
inhabitants
and
their
possessions
out
by
the
other
gates.
In
spite
of
Rostopchin's
broadsheets,
or
because
of
them
or
independently
of
them,
the
strangest
and
most
contradictory
rumors
were
current
in
the
town.
Some
said
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
city,
others
on
the
contrary
said
that
all
the
icons
had
been
taken
out
of
the
churches
and
everybody
was
to
be
ordered
to
leave.
Some
said
there
had
been
another
battle
after
Borodino
at
which
the
French
had
been
routed,
while
others
on
the
contrary
reported
that
the
Russian
army
had
been
destroyed.
Some
talked
about
the
Moscow
militia
which,
preceded
by
the
clergy,
would
go
to
the
Three
Hills;
others
whispered
that
Augustin
had
been
forbidden
to
leave,
that
traitors
had
been
seized,
that
the
peasants
were
rioting
and
robbing
people
on
their
way
from
Moscow,
and
so
on.
But
all
this
was
only
talk;
in
reality
(though
the
Council
of
Fili,
at
which
it
was
decided
to
abandon
Moscow,
had
not
yet
been
held)
both
those
who
went
away
and
those
who
remained
behind
felt,
though
they
did
not
show
it,
that
Moscow
would
certainly
be
abandoned,
and
that
they
ought
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
and
save
their
belongings.
It
was
felt
that
everything
would
suddenly
break
up
and
change,
but
up
to
the
first
of
September
nothing
had
done
so.
As
a
criminal
who
is
being
led
to
execution
knows
that
he
must
die
immediately,
but
yet
looks
about
him
and
straightens
the
cap
that
is
awry
on
his
head,
so
Moscow
involuntarily
continued
its
wonted
life,
though
it
knew
that
the
time
of
its
destruction
was
near
when
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
its
people
were
accustomed
to
submit
would
be
completely
upset.
During
the
three
days
preceding
the
occupation
of
Moscow
the
whole
Rostov
family
was
absorbed
in
various
activities.
The
head
of
the
family,
Count
Ilya
Rostov,
continually
drove
about
the
city
collecting
the
current
rumors
from
all
sides
and
gave
superficial
and
hasty
orders
at
home
about
the
preparations
for
their
departure.
The
countess
watched
the
things
being
packed,
was
dissatisfied
with
everything,
was
constantly
in
pursuit
of
Petya
who
was
always
running
away
from
her,
and
was
jealous
of
Natasha
with
whom
he
spent
all
his
time.
Sonya
alone
directed
the
practical
side
of
matters
by
getting
things
packed.
But
of
late
Sonya
had
been
particularly
sad
and
silent.
Nicholas'
letter
in
which
he
mentioned
Princess
Mary
had
elicited,
in
her
presence,
joyous
comments
from
the
countess,
who
saw
an
intervention
of
Providence
in
this
meeting
of
the
princess
and
Nicholas.
"I
was
never
pleased
at
Bolkonski's
engagement
to
Natasha,"
said
the
countess,
"but
I
always
wanted
Nicholas
to
marry
the
princess,
and
had
a
presentiment
that
it
would
happen.
What
a
good
thing
it
would
be!"
Sonya
felt
that
this
was
true:
that
the
only
possibility
of
retrieving
the
Rostovs'
affairs
was
by
Nicholas
marrying
a
rich
woman,
and
that
the
princess
was
a
good
match.
It
was
very
bitter
for
her.
But
despite
her
grief,
or
perhaps
just
because
of
it,
she
took
on
herself
all
the
difficult
work
of
directing
the
storing
and
packing
of
their
things
and
was
busy
for
whole
days.
The
count
and
countess
turned
to
her
when
they
had
any
orders
to
give.
Petya
and
Natasha
on
the
contrary,
far
from
helping
their
parents,
were
generally
a
nuisance
and
a
hindrance
to
everyone.
Almost
all
day
long
the
house
resounded
with
their
running
feet,
their
cries,
and
their
spontaneous
laughter.
They
laughed
and
were
gay
not
because
there
was
any
reason
to
laugh,
but
because
gaiety
and
mirth
were
in
their
hearts
and
so
everything
that
happened
was
a
cause
for
gaiety
and
laughter
to
them.
Petya
was
in
high
spirits
because
having
left
home
a
boy
he
had
returned
(as
everybody
told
him)
a
fine
young
man,
because
he
was
at
home,
because
he
had
left
Belaya
Tserkov
where
there
was
no
hope
of
soon
taking
part
in
a
battle
and
had
come
to
Moscow
where
there
was
to
be
fighting
in
a
few
days,
and
chiefly
because
Natasha,
whose
lead
he
always
followed,
was
in
high
spirits.
Natasha
was
gay
because
she
had
been
sad
too
long
and
now
nothing
reminded
her
of
the
cause
of
her
sadness,
and
because
she
was
feeling
well.
She
was
also
happy
because
she
had
someone
to
adore
her:
the
adoration
of
others
was
a
lubricant
the
wheels
of
her
machine
needed
to
make
them
run
freely--
and
Petya
adored
her.
Above
all,
they
were
gay
because
there
was
a
war
near
Moscow,
there
would
be
fighting
at
the
town
gates,
arms
were
being
given
out,
everybody
was
escaping--going
away
somewhere,
and
in
general
something
extraordinary
was
happening,
and
that
is
always
exciting,
especially
to
the
young.
CHAPTER
XIII
On
Saturday,
the
thirty-first
of
August,
everything
in
the
Rostovs'
house
seemed
topsy-turvy.
All
the
doors
were
open,
all
the
furniture
was
being
carried
out
or
moved
about,
and
the
mirrors
and
pictures
had
been
taken
down.
There
were
trunks
in
the
rooms,
and
hay,
wrapping
paper,
and
ropes
were
scattered
about.
The
peasants
and
house
serfs
carrying
out
the
things
were
treading
heavily
on
the
parquet
floors.
The
yard
was
crowded
with
peasant
carts,
some
loaded
high
and
already
corded
up,
others
still
empty.
The
voices
and
footsteps
of
the
many
servants
and
of
the
peasants
who
had
come
with
the
carts
resounded
as
they
shouted
to
one
another
in
the
yard
and
in
the
house.
The
count
had
been
out
since
morning.
The
countess
had
a
headache
brought
on
by
all
the
noise
and
turmoil
and
was
lying
down
in
the
new
sitting
room
with
a
vinegar
compress
on
her
head.
Petya
was
not
at
home,
he
had
gone
to
visit
a
friend
with
whom
he
meant
to
obtain
a
transfer
from
the
militia
to
the
active
army.
Sonya
was
in
the
ballroom
looking
after
the
packing
of
the
glass
and
china.
Natasha
was
sitting
on
the
floor
of
her
dismantled
room
with
dresses,
ribbons,
and
scarves
strewn
all
about
her,
gazing
fixedly
at
the
floor
and
holding
in
her
hands
the
old
ball
dress
(already
out
of
fashion)
which
she
had
worn
at
her
first
Petersburg
ball.
Natasha
was
ashamed
of
doing
nothing
when
everyone
else
was
so
busy,
and
several
times
that
morning
had
tried
to
set
to
work,
but
her
heart
was
not
in
it,
and
she
could
not
and
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
except
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
might.
For
a
while
she
had
stood
beside
Sonya
while
the
china
was
being
packed
and
tried
to
help,
but
soon
gave
it
up
and
went
to
her
room
to
pack
her
own
things.
At
first
she
found
it
amusing
to
give
away
dresses
and
ribbons
to
the
maids,
but
when
that
was
done
and
what
was
left
had
still
to
be
packed,
she
found
it
dull.
"Dunyasha,
you
pack!
You
will,
won't
you,
dear?"
And
when
Dunyasha
willingly
promised
to
do
it
all
for
her,
Natasha
sat
down
on
the
floor,
took
her
old
ball
dress,
and
fell
into
a
reverie
quite
unrelated
to
what
ought
to
have
occupied
her
thoughts
now.
She
was
roused
from
her
reverie
by
the
talk
of
the
maids
in
the
next
room
(which
was
theirs)
and
by
the
sound
of
their
hurried
footsteps
going
to
the
back
porch.
Natasha
got
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window.
An
enormously
long
row
of
carts
full
of
wounded
men
had
stopped
in
the
street.
The
housekeeper,
the
old
nurse,
the
cooks,
coachmen,
maids,
footmen,
postilions,
and
scullions
stood
at
the
gate,
staring
at
the
wounded.
Natasha,
throwing
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
over
her
hair
and
holding
an
end
of
it
in
each
hand,
went
out
into
the
street.
The
former
housekeeper,
old
Mavra
Kuzminichna,
had
stepped
out
of
the
crowd
by
the
gate,
gone
up
to
a
cart
with
a
hood
constructed
of
bast
mats,
and
was
speaking
to
a
pale
young
officer
who
lay
inside.
Natasha
moved
a
few
steps
forward
and
stopped
shyly,
still
holding
her
handkerchief,
and
listened
to
what
the
housekeeper
was
saying.
"Then
you
have
nobody
in
Moscow?"
she
was
saying.
"You
would
be
more
comfortable
somewhere
in
a
house...
in
ours,
for
instance...
the
family
are
leaving."
"I
don't
know
if
it
would
be
allowed,"
replied
the
officer
in
a
weak
voice.
"Here
is
our
commanding
officer...
ask
him,"
and
he
pointed
to
a
stout
major
who
was
walking
back
along
the
street
past
the
row
of
carts.
Natasha
glanced
with
frightened
eyes
at
the
face
of
the
wounded
officer
and
at
once
went
to
meet
the
major.
"May
the
wounded
men
stay
in
our
house?"
she
asked.
The
major
raised
his
hand
to
his
cap
with
a
smile.
"Which
one
do
you
want,
Ma'am'selle?"
said
he,
screwing
up
his
eyes
and
smiling.
Natasha
quietly
repeated
her
question,
and
her
face
and
whole
manner
were
so
serious,
though
she
was
still
holding
the
ends
of
her
handkerchief,
that
the
major
ceased
smiling
and
after
some
reflection--
as
if
considering
in
how
far
the
thing
was
possible--replied
in
the
affirmative.
"Oh
yes,
why
not?
They
may,"
he
said.
With
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head,
Natasha
stepped
back
quickly
to
Mavra
Kuzminichna,
who
stood
talking
compassionately
to
the
officer.
"They
may.
He
says
they
may!"
whispered
Natasha.
The
cart
in
which
the
officer
lay
was
turned
into
the
Rostovs'
yard,
and
dozens
of
carts
with
wounded
men
began
at
the
invitation
of
the
townsfolk
to
turn
into
the
yards
and
to
draw
up
at
the
entrances
of
the
houses
in
Povarskaya
Street.
Natasha
was
evidently
pleased
to
be
dealing
with
new
people
outside
the
ordinary
routine
of
her
life.
She
and
Mavra
Kuzminichna
tried
to
get
as
many
of
the
wounded
as
possible
into
their
yard.
"Your
Papa
must
be
told,
though,"
said
Mavra
Kuzminichna.
"Never
mind,
never
mind,
what
does
it
matter?
For
one
day
we
can
move
into
the
drawing
room.
They
can
have
all
our
half
of
the
house."
"There
now,
young
lady,
you
do
take
things
into
your
head!
Even
if
we
put
them
into
the
wing,
the
men's
room,
or
the
nurse's
room,
we
must
ask
permission."
"Well,
I'll
ask."
Natasha
ran
into
the
house
and
went
on
tiptoe
through
the
half-open
door
into
the
sitting
room,
where
there
was
a
smell
of
vinegar
and
Hoffman's
drops.
"Are
you
asleep,
Mamma?"
"Oh,
what
sleep-?"
said
the
countess,
waking
up
just
as
she
was
dropping
into
a
doze.
"Mamma
darling!"
said
Natasha,
kneeling
by
her
mother
and
bringing
her
face
close
to
her
mother's,
"I
am
sorry,
forgive
me,
I'll
never
do
it
again;
I
woke
you
up!
Mavra
Kuzminichna
has
sent
me:
they
have
brought
some
wounded
here--officers.
Will
you
let
them
come?
They
have
nowhere
to
go.
I
knew
you'd
let
them
come!"
she
said
quickly
all
in
one
breath.
"What
officers?
Whom
have
they
brought?
I
don't
understand
anything
about
it,"
said
the
countess.
Natasha
laughed,
and
the
countess
too
smiled
slightly.
"I
knew
you'd
give
permission...
so
I'll
tell
them,"
and,
having
kissed
her
mother,
Natasha
got
up
and
went
to
the
door.
In
the
hall
she
met
her
father,
who
had
returned
with
bad
news.
"We've
stayed
too
long!"
said
the
count
with
involuntary
vexation.
"The
club
is
closed
and
the
police
are
leaving."
"Papa,
is
it
all
right--I've
invited
some
of
the
wounded
into
the
house?"
said
Natasha.
"Of
course
it
is,"
he
answered
absently.
"That's
not
the
point.
I
beg
you
not
to
indulge
in
trifles
now,
but
to
help
to
pack,
and
tomorrow
we
must
go,
go,
go!...."
And
the
count
gave
a
similar
order
to
the
major-domo
and
the
servants.
At
dinner
Petya
having
returned
home
told
them
the
news
he
had
heard.
He
said
the
people
had
been
getting
arms
in
the
Kremlin,
and
that
though
Rostopchin's
broadsheet
had
said
that
he
would
sound
a
call
two
or
three
days
in
advance,
the
order
had
certainly
already
been
given
for
everyone
to
go
armed
to
the
Three
Hills
tomorrow,
and
that
there
would
be
a
big
battle
there.
The
countess
looked
with
timid
horror
at
her
son's
eager,
excited
face
as
he
said
this.
She
realized
that
if
she
said
a
word
about
his
not
going
to
the
battle
(she
knew
he
enjoyed
the
thought
of
the
impending
engagement)
he
would
say
something
about
men,
honor,
and
the
fatherland-
-something
senseless,
masculine,
and
obstinate
which
there
would
be
no
contradicting,
and
her
plans
would
be
spoiled;
and
so,
hoping
to
arrange
to
leave
before
then
and
take
Petya
with
her
as
their
protector
and
defender,
she
did
not
answer
him,
but
after
dinner
called
the
count
aside
and
implored
him
with
tears
to
take
her
away
quickly,
that
very
night
if
possible.
With
a
woman's
involuntary
loving
cunning
she,
who
till
then
had
not
shown
any
alarm,
said
that
she
would
die
of
fright
if
they
did
not
leave
that
very
night.
Without
any
pretense
she
was
now
afraid
of
everything.
CHAPTER
XIV
Madame
Schoss,
who
had
been
out
to
visit
her
daughter,
increased
the
countess'
fears
still
more
by
telling
what
she
had
seen
at
a
spirit
dealer's
in
Myasnitski
Street.
When
returning
by
that
street
she
had
been
unable
to
pass
because
of
a
drunken
crowd
rioting
in
front
of
the
shop.
She
had
taken
a
cab
and
driven
home
by
a
side
street
and
the
cabman
had
told
her
that
the
people
were
breaking
open
the
barrels
at
the
drink
store,
having
received
orders
to
do
so.
After
dinner
the
whole
Rostov
household
set
to
work
with
enthusiastic
haste
packing
their
belongings
and
preparing
for
their
departure.
The
old
count,
suddenly
setting
to
work,
kept
passing
from
the
yard
to
the
house
and
back
again,
shouting
confused
instructions
to
the
hurrying
people,
and
flurrying
them
still
more.
Petya
directed
things
in
the
yard.
Sonya,
owing
to
the
count's
contradictory
orders,
lost
her
head
and
did
not
know
what
to
do.
The
servants
ran
noisily
about
the
house
and
yard,
shouting
and
disputing.
Natasha,
with
the
ardor
characteristic
of
all
she
did
suddenly
set
to
work
too.
At
first
her
intervention
in
the
business
of
packing
was
received
skeptically.
Everybody
expected
some
prank
from
her
and
did
not
wish
to
obey
her;
but
she
resolutely
and
passionately
demanded
obedience,
grew
angry
and
nearly
cried
because
they
did
not
heed
her,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
making
them
believe
her.
Her
first
exploit,
which
cost
her
immense
effort
and
established
her
authority,
was
the
packing
of
the
carpets.
The
count
had
valuable
Gobelin
tapestries
and
Persian
carpets
in
the
house.
When
Natasha
set
to
work
two
cases
were
standing
open
in
the
ballroom,
one
almost
full
up
with
crockery,
the
other
with
carpets.
There
was
also
much
china
standing
on
the
tables,
and
still
more
was
being
brought
in
from
the
storeroom.
A
third
case
was
needed
and
servants
had
gone
to
fetch
it.
"Sonya,
wait
a
bit--we'll
pack
everything
into
these,"
said
Natasha.
"You
can't,
Miss,
we
have
tried
to,"
said
the
butler's
assistant.
"No,
wait
a
minute,
please."
And
Natasha
began
rapidly
taking
out
of
the
case
dishes
and
plates
wrapped
in
paper.
"The
dishes
must
go
in
here
among
the
carpets,"
said
she.
"Why,
it's
a
mercy
if
we
can
get
the
carpets
alone
into
three
cases,"
said
the
butler's
assistant.
"Oh,
wait,
please!"
And
Natasha
began
rapidly
and
deftly
sorting
out
the
things.
"These
aren't
needed,"
said
she,
putting
aside
some
plates
of
Kiev
ware.
"These--yes,
these
must
go
among
the
carpets,"
she
said,
referring
to
the
Saxony
china
dishes.
"Don't,
Natasha!
Leave
it
alone!
We'll
get
it
all
packed,"
urged
Sonya
reproachfully.
"What
a
young
lady
she
is!"
remarked
the
major-domo.
But
Natasha
would
not
give
in.
She
turned
everything
out
and
began
quickly
repacking,
deciding
that
the
inferior
Russian
carpets
and
unnecessary
crockery
should
not
be
taken
at
all.
When
everything
had
been
taken
out
of
the
cases,
they
recommenced
packing,
and
it
turned
out
that
when
the
cheaper
things
not
worth
taking
had
nearly
all
been
rejected,
the
valuable
ones
really
did
all
go
into
the
two
cases.
Only
the
lid
of
the
case
containing
the
carpets
would
not
shut
down.
A
few
more
things
might
have
been
taken
out,
but
Natasha
insisted
on
having
her
own
way.
She
packed,
repacked,
pressed,
made
the
butler's
assistant
and
Petya--whom
she
had
drawn
into
the
business
of
packing--press
on
the
lid,
and
made
desperate
efforts
herself.
"That's
enough,
Natasha,"
said
Sonya.
"I
see
you
were
right,
but
just
take
out
the
top
one."
"I
won't!"
cried
Natasha,
with
one
hand
holding
back
the
hair
that
hung
over
her
perspiring
face,
while
with
the
other
she
pressed
down
the
carpets.
"Now
press,
Petya!
Press,
Vasilich,
press
hard!"
she
cried.
The
carpets
yielded
and
the
lid
closed;
Natasha,
clapping
her
hands,
screamed
with
delight
and
tears
fell
from
her
eyes.
But
this
only
lasted
a
moment.
She
at
once
set
to
work
afresh
and
they
now
trusted
her
completely.
The
count
was
not
angry
even
when
they
told
him
that
Natasha
had
countermanded
an
order
of
his,
and
the
servants
now
came
to
her
to
ask
whether
a
cart
was
sufficiently
loaded,
and
whether
it
might
be
corded
up.
Thanks
to
Natasha's
directions
the
work
now
went
on
expeditiously,
unnecessary
things
were
left,
and
the
most
valuable
packed
as
compactly
as
possible.
But
hard
as
they
all
worked
till
quite
late
that
night,
they
could
not
get
everything
packed.
The
countess
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
count,
having
put
off
their
departure
till
next
morning,
went
to
bed.
Sonya
and
Natasha
slept
in
the
sitting
room
without
undressing.
That
night
another
wounded
man
was
driven
down
the
Povarskaya,
and
Mavra
Kuzminichna,
who
was
standing
at
the
gate,
had
him
brought
into
the
Rostovs'
yard.
Mavra
Kuzminichna
concluded
that
he
was
a
very
important
man.
He
was
being
conveyed
in
a
caleche
with
a
raised
hood,
and
was
quite
covered
by
an
apron.
On
the
box
beside
the
driver
sat
a
venerable
old
attendant.
A
doctor
and
two
soldiers
followed
the
carriage
in
a
cart.
"Please
come
in
here.
The
masters
are
going
away
and
the
whole
house
will
be
empty,"
said
the
old
woman
to
the
old
attendant.
"Well,
perhaps,"
said
he
with
a
sigh.
"We
don't
expect
to
get
him
home
alive!
We
have
a
house
of
our
own
in
Moscow,
but
it's
a
long
way
from
here,
and
there's
nobody
living
in
it."
"Do
us
the
honor
to
come
in,
there's
plenty
of
everything
in
the
master's
house.
Come
in,"
said
Mavra
Kuzminichna.
"Is
he
very
ill?"
she
asked.
The
attendant
made
a
hopeless
gesture.
"We
don't
expect
to
get
him
home!
We
must
ask
the
doctor."
And
the
old
servant
got
down
from
the
box
and
went
up
to
the
cart.
"All
right!"
said
the
doctor.
The
old
servant
returned
to
the
caleche,
looked
into
it,
shook
his
head
disconsolately,
told
the
driver
to
turn
into
the
yard,
and
stopped
beside
Mavra
Kuzminichna.
"O,
Lord
Jesus
Christ!"
she
murmured.
She
invited
them
to
take
the
wounded
man
into
the
house.
"The
masters
won't
object..."
she
said.
But
they
had
to
avoid
carrying
the
man
upstairs,
and
so
they
took
him
into
the
wing
and
put
him
in
the
room
that
had
been
Madame
Schoss'.
This
wounded
man
was
Prince
Andrew
Bolkonski.
CHAPTER
XV
Moscow's
last
day
had
come.
It
was
a
clear
bright
autumn
day,
a
Sunday.
The
church
bells
everywhere
were
ringing
for
service,
just
as
usual
on
Sundays.
Nobody
seemed
yet
to
realize
what
awaited
the
city.
Only
two
things
indicated
the
social
condition
of
Moscow--the
rabble,
that
is
the
poor
people,
and
the
price
of
commodities.
An
enormous
crowd
of
factory
hands,
house
serfs,
and
peasants,
with
whom
some
officials,
seminarists,
and
gentry
were
mingled,
had
gone
early
that
morning
to
the
Three
Hills.
Having
waited
there
for
Rostopchin
who
did
not
turn
up,
they
became
convinced
that
Moscow
would
be
surrendered,
and
then
dispersed
all
about
the
town
to
the
public
houses
and
cookshops.
Prices
too
that
day
indicated
the
state
of
affairs.
The
price
of
weapons,
of
gold,
of
carts
and
horses,
kept
rising,
but
the
value
of
paper
money
and
city
articles
kept
falling,
so
that
by
midday
there
were
instances
of
carters
removing
valuable
goods,
such
as
cloth,
and
receiving
in
payment
a
half
of
what
they
carted,
while
peasant
horses
were
fetching
five
hundred
rubles
each,
and
furniture,
mirrors,
and
bronzes
were
being
given
away
for
nothing.
In
the
Rostovs'
staid
old-fashioned
house
the
dissolution
of
former
conditions
of
life
was
but
little
noticeable.
As
to
the
serfs
the
only
indication
was
that
three
out
of
their
huge
retinue
disappeared
during
the
night,
but
nothing
was
stolen;
and
as
to
the
value
of
their
possessions,
the
thirty
peasant
carts
that
had
come
in
from
their
estates
and
which
many
people
envied
proved
to
be
extremely
valuable
and
they
were
offered
enormous
sums
of
money
for
them.
Not
only
were
huge
sums
offered
for
the
horses
and
carts,
but
on
the
previous
evening
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
first
of
September,
orderlies
and
servants
sent
by
wounded
officers
came
to
the
Rostovs'
and
wounded
men
dragged
themselves
there
from
the
Rostovs'
and
from
neighboring
houses
where
they
were
accommodated,
entreating
the
servants
to
try
to
get
them
a
lift
out
of
Moscow.
The
major-domo
to
whom
these
entreaties
were
addressed,
though
he
was
sorry
for
the
wounded,
resolutely
refused,
saying
that
he
dare
not
even
mention
the
matter
to
the
count.
Pity
these
wounded
men
as
one
might,
it
was
evident
that
if
they
were
given
one
cart
there
would
be
no
reason
to
refuse
another,
or
all
the
carts
and
one's
own
carriages
as
well.
Thirty
carts
could
not
save
all
the
wounded
and
in
the
general
catastrophe
one
could
not
disregard
oneself
and
one's
own
family.
So
thought
the
major-domo
on
his
master's
behalf.
On
waking
up
that
morning
Count
Ilya
Rostov
left
his
bedroom
softly,
so
as
not
to
wake
the
countess
who
had
fallen
asleep
only
toward
morning,
and
came
out
to
the
porch
in
his
lilac
silk
dressing
gown.
In
the
yard
stood
the
carts
ready
corded.
The
carriages
were
at
the
front
porch.
The
major-domo
stood
at
the
porch
talking
to
an
elderly
orderly
and
to
a
pale
young
officer
with
a
bandaged
arm.
On
seeing
the
count
the
major-
domo
made
a
significant
and
stern
gesture
to
them
both
to
go
away.
"Well,
Vasilich,
is
everything
ready?"
asked
the
count,
and
stroking
his
bald
head
he
looked
good-naturedly
at
the
officer
and
the
orderly
and
nodded
to
them.
(He
liked
to
see
new
faces.)
"We
can
harness
at
once,
your
excellency."
"Well,
that's
right.
As
soon
as
the
countess
wakes
we'll
be
off,
God
willing!
What
is
it,
gentlemen?"
he
added,
turning
to
the
officer.
"Are
you
staying
in
my
house?"
The
officer
came
nearer
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed
crimson.
"Count,
be
so
good
as
to
allow
me...
for
God's
sake,
to
get
into
some
corner
of
one
of
your
carts!
I
have
nothing
here
with
me....
I
shall
be
all
right
on
a
loaded
cart..."
Before
the
officer
had
finished
speaking
the
orderly
made
the
same
request
on
behalf
of
his
master.
"Oh,
yes,
yes,
yes!"
said
the
count
hastily.
"I
shall
be
very
pleased,
very
pleased.
Vasilich,
you'll
see
to
it.
Just
unload
one
or
two
carts.
Well,
what
of
it...
do
what's
necessary..."
said
the
count,
muttering
some
indefinite
order.
But
at
the
same
moment
an
expression
of
warm
gratitude
on
the
officer's
face
had
already
sealed
the
order.
The
count
looked
around
him.
In
the
yard,
at
the
gates,
at
the
window
of
the
wings,
wounded
officers
and
their
orderlies
were
to
be
seen.
They
were
all
looking
at
the
count
and
moving
toward
the
porch.
"Please
step
into
the
gallery,
your
excellency,"
said
the
major-domo.
"What
are
your
orders
about
the
pictures?"
The
count
went
into
the
house
with
him,
repeating
his
order
not
to
refuse
the
wounded
who
asked
for
a
lift.
"Well,
never
mind,
some
of
the
things
can
be
unloaded,"
he
added
in
a
soft,
confidential
voice,
as
though
afraid
of
being
overheard.
At
nine
o'clock
the
countess
woke
up,
and
Matrena
Timofeevna,
who
had
been
her
lady's
maid
before
her
marriage
and
now
performed
a
sort
of
chief
gendarme's
duty
for
her,
came
to
say
that
Madame
Schoss
was
much
offended
and
the
young
ladies'
summer
dresses
could
not
be
left
behind.
On
inquiry,
the
countess
learned
that
Madame
Schoss
was
offended
because
her
trunk
had
been
taken
down
from
its
cart,
and
all
the
loads
were
being
uncorded
and
the
luggage
taken
out
of
the
carts
to
make
room
for
wounded
men
whom
the
count
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
had
ordered
that
they
should
take
with
them.
The
countess
sent
for
her
husband.
"What
is
this,
my
dear?
I
hear
that
the
luggage
is
being
unloaded."
"You
know,
love,
I
wanted
to
tell
you...
Countess
dear...
an
officer
came
to
me
to
ask
for
a
few
carts
for
the
wounded.
After
all,
ours
are
things
that
can
be
bought
but
think
what
being
left
behind
means
to
them!...
Really
now,
in
our
own
yard--we
asked
them
in
ourselves
and
there
are
officers
among
them....
You
know,
I
think,
my
dear...
let
them
be
taken...
where's
the
hurry?"
The
count
spoke
timidly,
as
he
always
did
when
talking
of
money
matters.
The
countess
was
accustomed
to
this
tone
as
a
precursor
of
news
of
something
detrimental
to
the
children's
interests,
such
as
the
building
of
a
new
gallery
or
conservatory,
the
inauguration
of
a
private
theater
or
an
orchestra.
She
was
accustomed
always
to
oppose
anything
announced
in
that
timid
tone
and
considered
it
her
duty
to
do
so.
She
assumed
her
dolefully
submissive
manner
and
said
to
her
husband:
"Listen
to
me,
Count,
you
have
managed
matters
so
that
we
are
getting
nothing
for
the
house,
and
now
you
wish
to
throw
away
all
our--all
the
children's
property!
You
said
yourself
that
we
have
a
hundred
thousand
rubles'
worth
of
things
in
the
house.
I
don't
consent,
my
dear,
I
don't!
Do
as
you
please!
It's
the
government's
business
to
look
after
the
wounded;
they
know
that.
Look
at
the
Lopukhins
opposite,
they
cleared
out
everything
two
days
ago.
That's
what
other
people
do.
It's
only
we
who
are
such
fools.
If
you
have
no
pity
on
me,
have
some
for
the
children."
Flourishing
his
arms
in
despair
the
count
left
the
room
without
replying.
"Papa,
what
are
you
doing
that
for?"
asked
Natasha,
who
had
followed
him
into
her
mother's
room.
"Nothing!
What
business
is
it
of
yours?"
muttered
the
count
angrily.
"But
I
heard,"
said
Natasha.
"Why
does
Mamma
object?"
"What
business
is
it
of
yours?"
cried
the
count.
Natasha
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
pondered.
"Papa!
Here's
Berg
coming
to
see
us,"
said
she,
looking
out
of
the
window.
CHAPTER
XVI
Berg,
the
Rostovs'
son-in-law,
was
already
a
colonel
wearing
the
orders
of
Vladimir
and
Anna,
and
he
still
filled
the
quiet
and
agreeable
post
of
assistant
to
the
head
of
the
staff
of
the
assistant
commander
of
the
first
division
of
the
Second
Army.
On
the
first
of
September
he
had
come
to
Moscow
from
the
army.
He
had
nothing
to
do
in
Moscow,
but
he
had
noticed
that
everyone
in
the
army
was
asking
for
leave
to
visit
Moscow
and
had
something
to
do
there.
So
he
considered
it
necessary
to
ask
for
leave
of
absence
for
family
and
domestic
reasons.
Berg
drove
up
to
his
father-in-law's
house
in
his
spruce
little
trap
with
a
pair
of
sleek
roans,
exactly
like
those
of
a
certain
prince.
He
looked
attentively
at
the
carts
in
the
yard
and
while
going
up
to
the
porch
took
out
a
clean
pocket
handkerchief
and
tied
a
knot
in
it.
From
the
anteroom
Berg
ran
with
smooth
though
impatient
steps
into
the
drawing
room,
where
he
embraced
the
count,
kissed
the
hands
of
Natasha
and
Sonya,
and
hastened
to
inquire
after
"Mamma's"
health.
"Health,
at
a
time
like
this?"
said
the
count.
"Come,
tell
us
the
news!
Is
the
army
retreating
or
will
there
be
another
battle?"
"God
Almighty
alone
can
decide
the
fate
of
our
fatherland,
Papa,"
said
Berg.
"The
army
is
burning
with
a
spirit
of
heroism
and
the
leaders,
so
to
say,
have
now
assembled
in
council.
No
one
knows
what
is
coming.
But
in
general
I
can
tell
you,
Papa,
that
such
a
heroic
spirit,
the
truly
antique
valor
of
the
Russian
army,
which
they--which
it"
(he
corrected
himself)
"has
shown
or
displayed
in
the
battle
of
the
twenty-sixth--
there
are
no
words
worthy
to
do
it
justice!
I
tell
you,
Papa"
(he
smote
himself
on
the
breast
as
a
general
he
had
heard
speaking
had
done,
but
Berg
did
it
a
trifle
late
for
he
should
have
struck
his
breast
at
the
words
"Russian
army"),
"I
tell
you
frankly
that
we,
the
commanders,
far
from
having
to
urge
the
men
on
or
anything
of
that
kind,
could
hardly
restrain
those...
those...
yes,
those
exploits
of
antique
valor,"
he
went
on
rapidly.
"General
Barclay
de
Tolly
risked
his
life
everywhere
at
the
head
of
the
troops,
I
can
assure
you.
Our
corps
was
stationed
on
a
hillside.
You
can
imagine!"
And
Berg
related
all
that
he
remembered
of
the
various
tales
he
had
heard
those
days.
Natasha
watched
him
with
an
intent
gaze
that
confused
him,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
find
in
his
face
the
answer
to
some
question.
"Altogether
such
heroism
as
was
displayed
by
the
Russian
warriors
cannot
be
imagined
or
adequately
praised!"
said
Berg,
glancing
round
at
Natasha,
and
as
if
anxious
to
conciliate
her,
replying
to
her
intent
look
with
a
smile.
"'Russia
is
not
in
Moscow,
she
lives
in
the
hearts
of
her
sons!'
Isn't
it
so,
Papa?"
said
he.
Just
then
the
countess
came
in
from
the
sitting
room
with
a
weary
and
dissatisfied
expression.
Berg
hurriedly
jumped
up,
kissed
her
hand,
asked
about
her
health,
and,
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
express
sympathy,
remained
standing
beside
her.
"Yes,
Mamma,
I
tell
you
sincerely
that
these
are
hard
and
sad
times
for
every
Russian.
But
why
are
you
so
anxious?
You
have
still
time
to
get
away...."
"I
can't
think
what
the
servants
are
about,"
said
the
countess,
turning
to
her
husband.
"I
have
just
been
told
that
nothing
is
ready
yet.
Somebody
after
all
must
see
to
things.
One
misses
Mitenka
at
such
times.
There
won't
be
any
end
to
it."
The
count
was
about
to
say
something,
but
evidently
restrained
himself.
He
got
up
from
his
chair
and
went
to
the
door.
At
that
moment
Berg
drew
out
his
handkerchief
as
if
to
blow
his
nose
and,
seeing
the
knot
in
it,
pondered,
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
significantly.
"And
I
have
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you,
Papa,"
said
he.
"Hm..."
said
the
count,
and
stopped.
"I
was
driving
past
Yusupov's
house
just
now,"
said
Berg
with
a
laugh,
"when
the
steward,
a
man
I
know,
ran
out
and
asked
me
whether
I
wouldn't
buy
something.
I
went
in
out
of
curiosity,
you
know,
and
there
is
a
small
chiffonier
and
a
dressing
table.
You
know
how
dear
Vera
wanted
a
chiffonier
like
that
and
how
we
had
a
dispute
about
it."
(At
the
mention
of
the
chiffonier
and
dressing
table
Berg
involuntarily
changed
his
tone
to
one
of
pleasure
at
his
admirable
domestic
arrangements.)
"And
it's
such
a
beauty!
It
pulls
out
and
has
a
secret
English
drawer,
you
know!
And
dear
Vera
has
long
wanted
one.
I
wish
to
give
her
a
surprise,
you
see.
I
saw
so
many
of
those
peasant
carts
in
your
yard.
Please
let
me
have
one,
I
will
pay
the
man
well,
and..."
The
count
frowned
and
coughed.
"Ask
the
countess,
I
don't
give
orders."
"If
it's
inconvenient,
please
don't,"
said
Berg.
"Only
I
so
wanted
it,
for
dear
Vera's
sake."
"Oh,
go
to
the
devil,
all
of
you!
To
the
devil,
the
devil,
the
devil..."
cried
the
old
count.
"My
head's
in
a
whirl!"
And
he
left
the
room.
The
countess
began
to
cry.
"Yes,
Mamma!
Yes,
these
are
very
hard
times!"
said
Berg.
Natasha
left
the
room
with
her
father
and,
as
if
finding
it
difficult
to
reach
some
decision,
first
followed
him
and
then
ran
downstairs.
Petya
was
in
the
porch,
engaged
in
giving
out
weapons
to
the
servants
who
were
to
leave
Moscow.
The
loaded
carts
were
still
standing
in
the
yard.
Two
of
them
had
been
uncorded
and
a
wounded
officer
was
climbing
into
one
of
them
helped
by
an
orderly.
"Do
you
know
what
it's
about?"
Petya
asked
Natasha.
She
understood
that
he
meant
what
were
their
parents
quarreling
about.
She
did
not
answer.
"It's
because
Papa
wanted
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded,"
said
Petya.
"Vasilich
told
me.
I
consider..."
"I
consider,"
Natasha
suddenly
almost
shouted,
turning
her
angry
face
to
Petya,
"I
consider
it
so
horrid,
so
abominable,
so...
I
don't
know
what.
Are
we
despicable
Germans?"
Her
throat
quivered
with
convulsive
sobs
and,
afraid
of
weakening
and
letting
the
force
of
her
anger
run
to
waste,
she
turned
and
rushed
headlong
up
the
stairs.
Berg
was
sitting
beside
the
countess
consoling
her
with
the
respectful
attention
of
a
relative.
The
count,
pipe
in
hand,
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room,
when
Natasha,
her
face
distorted
by
anger,
burst
in
like
a
tempest
and
approached
her
mother
with
rapid
steps.
"It's
horrid!
It's
abominable!"
she
screamed.
"You
can't
possibly
have
ordered
it!"
Berg
and
the
countess
looked
at
her,
perplexed
and
frightened.
The
count
stood
still
at
the
window
and
listened.
"Mamma,
it's
impossible:
see
what
is
going
on
in
the
yard!"
she
cried.
"They
will
be
left!..."
"What's
the
matter
with
you?
Who
are
'they'?
What
do
you
want?"
"Why,
the
wounded!
It's
impossible,
Mamma.
It's
monstrous!...
No,
Mamma
darling,
it's
not
the
thing.
Please
forgive
me,
darling....
Mamma,
what
does
it
matter
what
we
take
away?
Only
look
what
is
going
on
in
the
yard...
Mamma!...
It's
impossible!"
The
count
stood
by
the
window
and
listened
without
turning
round.
Suddenly
he
sniffed
and
put
his
face
closer
to
the
window.
The
countess
glanced
at
her
daughter,
saw
her
face
full
of
shame
for
her
mother,
saw
her
agitation,
and
understood
why
her
husband
did
not
turn
to
look
at
her
now,
and
she
glanced
round
quite
disconcerted.
"Oh,
do
as
you
like!
Am
I
hindering
anyone?"
she
said,
not
surrendering
at
once.
"Mamma,
darling,
forgive
me!"
But
the
countess
pushed
her
daughter
away
and
went
up
to
her
husband.
"My
dear,
you
order
what
is
right....
You
know
I
don't
understand
about
it,"
said
she,
dropping
her
eyes
shamefacedly.
"The
eggs...
the
eggs
are
teaching
the
hen,"
muttered
the
count
through
tears
of
joy,
and
he
embraced
his
wife
who
was
glad
to
hide
her
look
of
shame
on
his
breast.
"Papa!
Mamma!
May
I
see
to
it?
May
I?..."
asked
Natasha.
"We
will
still
take
all
the
most
necessary
things."
The
count
nodded
affirmatively,
and
Natasha,
at
the
rapid
pace
at
which
she
used
to
run
when
playing
at
tag,
ran
through
the
ballroom
to
the
anteroom
and
downstairs
into
the
yard.
The
servants
gathered
round
Natasha,
but
could
not
believe
the
strange
order
she
brought
them
until
the
count
himself,
in
his
wife's
name,
confirmed
the
order
to
give
up
all
the
carts
to
the
wounded
and
take
the
trunks
to
the
storerooms.
When
they
understood
that
order
the
servants
set
to
work
at
this
new
task
with
pleasure
and
zeal.
It
no
longer
seemed
strange
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done,
just
as
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
had
not
seemed
strange
to
anyone
that
the
wounded
should
be
left
behind
and
the
goods
carted
away
but
that
had
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do.
The
whole
household,
as
if
to
atone
for
not
having
done
it
sooner,
set
eagerly
to
work
at
the
new
task
of
placing
the
wounded
in
the
carts.
The
wounded
dragged
themselves
out
of
their
rooms
and
stood
with
pale
but
happy
faces
round
the
carts.
The
news
that
carts
were
to
be
had
spread
to
the
neighboring
houses,
from
which
wounded
men
began
to
come
into
the
Rostovs'
yard.
Many
of
the
wounded
asked
them
not
to
unload
the
carts
but
only
to
let
them
sit
on
the
top
of
the
things.
But
the
work
of
unloading,
once
started,
could
not
be
arrested.
It
seemed
not
to
matter
whether
all
or
only
half
the
things
were
left
behind.
Cases
full
of
china,
bronzes,
pictures,
and
mirrors
that
had
been
so
carefully
packed
the
night
before
now
lay
about
the
yard,
and
still
they
went
on
searching
for
and
finding
possibilities
of
unloading
this
or
that
and
letting
the
wounded
have
another
and
yet
another
cart.
"We
can
take
four
more
men,"
said
the
steward.
"They
can
have
my
trap,
or
else
what
is
to
become
of
them?"
"Let
them
have
my
wardrobe
cart,"
said
the
countess.
"Dunyasha
can
go
with
me
in
the
carriage."
They
unloaded
the
wardrobe
cart
and
sent
it
to
take
wounded
men
from
a
house
two
doors
off.
The
whole
household,
servants
included,
was
bright
and
animated.
Natasha
was
in
a
state
of
rapturous
excitement
such
as
she
had
not
known
for
a
long
time.
"What
could
we
fasten
this
onto?"
asked
the
servants,
trying
to
fix
a
trunk
on
the
narrow
footboard
behind
a
carriage.
"We
must
keep
at
least
one
cart."
"What's
in
it?"
asked
Natasha.
"The
count's
books."
"Leave
it,
Vasilich
will
put
it
away.
It's
not
wanted."
The
phaeton
was
full
of
people
and
there
was
a
doubt
as
to
where
Count
Peter
could
sit.
"On
the
box.
You'll
sit
on
the
box,
won't
you,
Petya?"
cried
Natasha.
Sonya
too
was
busy
all
this
time,
but
the
aim
of
her
efforts
was
quite
different
from
Natasha's.
She
was
putting
away
the
things
that
had
to
be
left
behind
and
making
a
list
of
them
as
the
countess
wished,
and
she
tried
to
get
as
much
taken
away
with
them
as
possible.
CHAPTER
XVII
Before
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
Rostovs'
four
carriages,
packed
full
and
with
the
horses
harnessed,
stood
at
the
front
door.
One
by
one
the
carts
with
the
wounded
had
moved
out
of
the
yard.
The
caleche
in
which
Prince
Andrew
was
being
taken
attracted
Sonya's
attention
as
it
passed
the
front
porch.
With
the
help
of
a
maid
she
was
arranging
a
seat
for
the
countess
in
the
huge
high
coach
that
stood
at
the
entrance.
"Whose
caleche
is
that?"
she
inquired,
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
window.
"Why,
didn't
you
know,
Miss?"
replied
the
maid.
"The
wounded
prince:
he
spent
the
night
in
our
house
and
is
going
with
us."
"But
who
is
it?
What's
his
name?"
"It's
our
intended
that
was--Prince
Bolkonski
himself!
They
say
he
is
dying,"
replied
the
maid
with
a
sigh.
Sonya
jumped
out
of
the
coach
and
ran
to
the
countess.
The
countess,
tired
out
and
already
dressed
in
shawl
and
bonnet
for
her
journey,
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
drawing
room,
waiting
for
the
household
to
assemble
for
the
usual
silent
prayer
with
closed
doors
before
starting.
Natasha
was
not
in
the
room.
"Mamma,"
said
Sonya,
"Prince
Andrew
is
here,
mortally
wounded.
He
is
going
with
us."
The
countess
opened
her
eyes
in
dismay
and,
seizing
Sonya's
arm,
glanced
around.
"Natasha?"
she
murmured.
At
that
moment
this
news
had
only
one
significance
for
both
of
them.
They
knew
their
Natasha,
and
alarm
as
to
what
would
happen
if
she
heard
this
news
stifled
all
sympathy
for
the
man
they
both
liked.
"Natasha
does
not
know
yet,
but
he
is
going
with
us,"
said
Sonya.
"You
say
he
is
dying?"
Sonya
nodded.
The
countess
put
her
arms
around
Sonya
and
began
to
cry.
"The
ways
of
God
are
past
finding
out!"
she
thought,
feeling
that
the
Almighty
Hand,
hitherto
unseen,
was
becoming
manifest
in
all
that
was
now
taking
place.
"Well,
Mamma?
Everything
is
ready.
What's
the
matter?"
asked
Natasha,
as
with
animated
face
she
ran
into
the
room.
"Nothing,"
answered
the
countess.
"If
everything
is
ready
let
us
start."
And
the
countess
bent
over
her
reticule
to
hide
her
agitated
face.
Sonya
embraced
Natasha
and
kissed
her.
Natasha
looked
at
her
inquiringly.
"What
is
it?
What
has
happened?"
"Nothing...
No..."
"Is
it
something
very
bad
for
me?
What
is
it?"
persisted
Natasha
with
her
quick
intuition.
Sonya
sighed
and
made
no
reply.
The
count,
Petya,
Madame
Schoss,
Mavra
Kuzminichna,
and
Vasilich
came
into
the
drawing
room
and,
having
closed
the
doors,
they
all
sat
down
and
remained
for
some
moments
silently
seated
without
looking
at
one
another.
The
count
was
the
first
to
rise,
and
with
a
loud
sigh
crossed
himself
before
the
icon.
All
the
others
did
the
same.
Then
the
count
embraced
Mavra
Kuzminichna
and
Vasilich,
who
were
to
remain
in
Moscow,
and
while
they
caught
at
his
hand
and
kissed
his
shoulder
he
patted
their
backs
lightly
with
some
vaguely
affectionate
and
comforting
words.
The
countess
went
into
the
oratory
and
there
Sonya
found
her
on
her
knees
before
the
icons
that
had
been
left
here
and
there
hanging
on
the
wall.
(The
most
precious
ones,
with
which
some
family
tradition
was
connected,
were
being
taken
with
them.)
In
the
porch
and
in
the
yard
the
men
whom
Petya
had
armed
with
swords
and
daggers,
with
trousers
tucked
inside
their
high
boots
and
with
belts
and
girdles
tightened,
were
taking
leave
of
those
remaining
behind.
As
is
always
the
case
at
a
departure,
much
had
been
forgotten
or
put
in
the
wrong
place,
and
for
a
long
time
two
menservants
stood
one
on
each
side
of
the
open
door
and
the
carriage
steps
waiting
to
help
the
countess
in,
while
maids
rushed
with
cushions
and
bundles
from
the
house
to
the
carriages,
the
caleche,
the
phaeton,
and
back
again.
"They
always
will
forget
everything!"
said
the
countess.
"Don't
you
know
I
can't
sit
like
that?"
And
Dunyasha,
with
clenched
teeth,
without
replying
but
with
an
aggrieved
look
on
her
face,
hastily
got
into
the
coach
to
rearrange
the
seat.
"Oh,
those
servants!"
said
the
count,
swaying
his
head.
Efim,
the
old
coachman,
who
was
the
only
one
the
countess
trusted
to
drive
her,
sat
perched
up
high
on
the
box
and
did
not
so
much
as
glance
round
at
what
was
going
on
behind
him.
From
thirty
years'
experience
he
knew
it
would
be
some
time
yet
before
the
order,
"Be
off,
in
God's
name!"
would
be
given
him:
and
he
knew
that
even
when
it
was
said
he
would
be
stopped
once
or
twice
more
while
they
sent
back
to
fetch
something
that
had
been
forgotten,
and
even
after
that
he
would
again
be
stopped
and
the
countess
herself
would
lean
out
of
the
window
and
beg
him
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
drive
carefully
down
the
hill.
He
knew
all
this
and
therefore
waited
calmly
for
what
would
happen,
with
more
patience
than
the
horses,
especially
the
near
one,
the
chestnut
Falcon,
who
was
pawing
the
ground
and
champing
his
bit.
At
last
all
were
seated,
the
carriage
steps
were
folded
and
pulled
up,
the
door
was
shut,
somebody
was
sent
for
a
traveling
case,
and
the
countess
leaned
out
and
said
what
she
had
to
say.
Then
Efim
deliberately
doffed
his
hat
and
began
crossing
himself.
The
postilion
and
all
the
other
servants
did
the
same.
"Off,
in
God's
name!"
said
Efim,
putting
on
his
hat.
"Start!"
The
postilion
started
the
horses,
the
off
pole
horse
tugged
at
his
collar,
the
high
springs
creaked,
and
the
body
of
the
coach
swayed.
The
footman
sprang
onto
the
box
of
the
moving
coach
which
jolted
as
it
passed
out
of
the
yard
onto
the
uneven
roadway;
the
other
vehicles
jolted
in
their
turn,
and
the
procession
of
carriages
moved
up
the
street.
In
the
carriages,
the
caleche,
and
the
phaeton,
all
crossed
themselves
as
they
passed
the
church
opposite
the
house.
Those
who
were
to
remain
in
Moscow
walked
on
either
side
of
the
vehicles
seeing
the
travelers
off.
Rarely
had
Natasha
experienced
so
joyful
a
feeling
as
now,
sitting
in
the
carriage
beside
the
countess
and
gazing
at
the
slowly
receding
walls
of
forsaken,
agitated
Moscow.
Occasionally
she
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
looked
back
and
then
forward
at
the
long
train
of
wounded
in
front
of
them.
Almost
at
the
head
of
the
line
she
could
see
the
raised
hood
of
Prince
Andrew's
caleche.
She
did
not
know
who
was
in
it,
but
each
time
she
looked
at
the
procession
her
eyes
sought
that
caleche.
She
knew
it
was
right
in
front.
In
Kudrino,
from
the
Nikitski,
Presnya,
and
Podnovinsk
Streets
came
several
other
trains
of
vehicles
similar
to
the
Rostovs',
and
as
they
passed
along
the
Sadovaya
Street
the
carriages
and
carts
formed
two
rows
abreast.
As
they
were
going
round
the
Sukharev
water
tower
Natasha,
who
was
inquisitively
and
alertly
scrutinizing
the
people
driving
or
walking
past,
suddenly
cried
out
in
joyful
surprise:
"Dear
me!
Mamma,
Sonya,
look,
it's
he!"
"Who?
Who?"
"Look!
Yes,
on
my
word,
it's
Bezukhov!"
said
Natasha,
putting
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
and
staring
at
a
tall,
stout
man
in
a
coachman's
long
coat,
who
from
his
manner
of
walking
and
moving
was
evidently
a
gentleman
in
disguise,
and
who
was
passing
under
the
arch
of
the
Sukharev
tower
accompanied
by
a
small,
sallow-faced,
beardless
old
man
in
a
frieze
coat.
"Yes,
it
really
is
Bezukhov
in
a
coachman's
coat,
with
a
queer-looking
old
boy.
Really,"
said
Natasha,
"look,
look!"
"No,
it's
not
he.
How
can
you
talk
such
nonsense?"
"Mamma,"
screamed
Natasha,
"I'll
stake
my
head
it's
he!
I
assure
you!
Stop,
stop!"
she
cried
to
the
coachman.
But
the
coachman
could
not
stop,
for
from
the
Meshchanski
Street
came
more
carts
and
carriages,
and
the
Rostovs
were
being
shouted
at
to
move
on
and
not
block
the
way.
In
fact,
however,
though
now
much
farther
off
than
before,
the
Rostovs
all
saw
Pierre--or
someone
extraordinarily
like
him--in
a
coachman's
coat,
going
down
the
street
with
head
bent
and
a
serious
face
beside
a
small,
beardless
old
man
who
looked
like
a
footman.
That
old
man
noticed
a
face
thrust
out
of
the
carriage
window
gazing
at
them,
and
respectfully
touching
Pierre's
elbow
said
something
to
him
and
pointed
to
the
carriage.
Pierre,
evidently
engrossed
in
thought,
could
not
at
first
understand
him.
At
length
when
he
had
understood
and
looked
in
the
direction
the
old
man
indicated,
he
recognized
Natasha,
and
following
his
first
impulse
stepped
instantly
and
rapidly
toward
the
coach.
But
having
taken
a
dozen
steps
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
stopped.
Natasha's
face,
leaning
out
of
the
window,
beamed
with
quizzical
kindliness.
"Peter
Kirilovich,
come
here!
We
have
recognized
you!
This
is
wonderful!"
she
cried,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him.
"What
are
you
doing?
Why
are
you
like
this?"
Pierre
took
her
outstretched
hand
and
kissed
it
awkwardly
as
he
walked
along
beside
her
while
the
coach
still
moved
on.
"What
is
the
matter,
Count?"
asked
the
countess
in
a
surprised
and
commiserating
tone.
"What?
What?
Why?
Don't
ask
me,"
said
Pierre,
and
looked
round
at
Natasha
whose
radiant,
happy
expression--of
which
he
was
conscious
without
looking
at
her--filled
him
with
enchantment.
"Are
you
remaining
in
Moscow,
then?"
Pierre
hesitated.
"In
Moscow?"
he
said
in
a
questioning
tone.
"Yes,
in
Moscow.
Good-bye!"
"Ah,
if
only
I
were
a
man!
I'd
certainly
stay
with
you.
How
splendid!"
said
Natasha.
"Mamma,
if
you'll
let
me,
I'll
stay!"
Pierre
glanced
absently
at
Natasha
and
was
about
to
say
something,
but
the
countess
interrupted
him.
"You
were
at
the
battle,
we
heard."
"Yes,
I
was,"
Pierre
answered.
"There
will
be
another
battle
tomorrow..."
he
began,
but
Natasha
interrupted
him.
"But
what
is
the
matter
with
you,
Count?
You
are
not
like
yourself...."
"Oh,
don't
ask
me,
don't
ask
me!
I
don't
know
myself.
Tomorrow...
But
no!
Good-bye,
good-by!"
he
muttered.
"It's
an
awful
time!"
and
dropping
behind
the
carriage
he
stepped
onto
the
pavement.
Natasha
continued
to
lean
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
time,
beaming
at
him
with
her
kindly,
slightly
quizzical,
happy
smile.
CHAPTER
XVIII
For
the
last
two
days,
ever
since
leaving
home,
Pierre
had
been
living
in
the
empty
house
of
his
deceased
benefactor,
Bazdeev.
This
is
how
it
happened.
When
he
woke
up
on
the
morning
after
his
return
to
Moscow
and
his
interview
with
Count
Rostopchin,
he
could
not
for
some
time
make
out
where
he
was
and
what
was
expected
of
him.
When
he
was
informed
that
among
others
awaiting
him
in
his
reception
room
there
was
a
Frenchman
who
had
brought
a
letter
from
his
wife,
the
Countess
Helene,
he
felt
suddenly
overcome
by
that
sense
of
confusion
and
hopelessness
to
which
he
was
apt
to
succumb.
He
felt
that
everything
was
now
at
an
end,
all
was
in
confusion
and
crumbling
to
pieces,
that
nobody
was
right
or
wrong,
the
future
held
nothing,
and
there
was
no
escape
from
this
position.
Smiling
unnaturally
and
muttering
to
himself,
he
first
sat
down
on
the
sofa
in
an
attitude
of
despair,
then
rose,
went
to
the
door
of
the
reception
room
and
peeped
through
the
crack,
returned
flourishing
his
arms,
and
took
up
a
book.
His
major-domo
came
in
a
second
time
to
say
that
the
Frenchman
who
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
countess
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
if
only
for
a
minute,
and
that
someone
from
Bazdeev's
widow
had
called
to
ask
Pierre
to
take
charge
of
her
husband's
books,
as
she
herself
was
leaving
for
the
country.
"Oh,
yes,
in
a
minute;
wait...
or
no!
No,
of
course...
go
and
say
I
will
come
directly,"
Pierre
replied
to
the
major-domo.
But
as
soon
as
the
man
had
left
the
room
Pierre
took
up
his
hat
which
was
lying
on
the
table
and
went
out
of
his
study
by
the
other
door.
There
was
no
one
in
the
passage.
He
went
along
the
whole
length
of
this
passage
to
the
stairs
and,
frowning
and
rubbing
his
forehead
with
both
hands,
went
down
as
far
as
the
first
landing.
The
hall
porter
was
standing
at
the
front
door.
From
the
landing
where
Pierre
stood
there
was
a
second
staircase
leading
to
the
back
entrance.
He
went
down
that
staircase
and
out
into
the
yard.
No
one
had
seen
him.
But
there
were
some
carriages
waiting,
and
as
soon
as
Pierre
stepped
out
of
the
gate
the
coachmen
and
the
yard
porter
noticed
him
and
raised
their
caps
to
him.
When
he
felt
he
was
being
looked
at
he
behaved
like
an
ostrich
which
hides
its
head
in
a
bush
in
order
not
to
be
seen:
he
hung
his
head
and
quickening
his
pace
went
down
the
street.
Of
all
the
affairs
awaiting
Pierre
that
day
the
sorting
of
Joseph
Bazdeev's
books
and
papers
appeared
to
him
the
most
necessary.
He
hired
the
first
cab
he
met
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
Patriarch's
Ponds,
where
the
widow
Bazdeev's
house
was.
Continually
turning
round
to
look
at
the
rows
of
loaded
carts
that
were
making
their
way
from
all
sides
out
of
Moscow,
and
balancing
his
bulky
body
so
as
not
to
slip
out
of
the
ramshackle
old
vehicle,
Pierre,
experiencing
the
joyful
feeling
of
a
boy
escaping
from
school,
began
to
talk
to
his
driver.
The
man
told
him
that
arms
were
being
distributed
today
at
the
Kremlin
and
that
tomorrow
everyone
would
be
sent
out
beyond
the
Three
Hills
gates
and
a
great
battle
would
be
fought
there.
Having
reached
the
Patriarch's
Ponds
Pierre
found
the
Bazdeevs'
house,
where
he
had
not
been
for
a
long
time
past.
He
went
up
to
the
gate.
Gerasim,
that
sallow
beardless
old
man
Pierre
had
seen
at
Torzhok
five
years
before
with
Joseph
Bazdeev,
came
out
in
answer
to
his
knock.
"At
home?"
asked
Pierre.
"Owing
to
the
present
state
of
things
Sophia
Danilovna
has
gone
to
the
Torzhok
estate
with
the
children,
your
excellency."
"I
will
come
in
all
the
same,
I
have
to
look
through
the
books,"
said
Pierre.
"Be
so
good
as
to
step
in.
Makar
Alexeevich,
the
brother
of
my
late
master--may
the
kingdom
of
heaven
be
his--has
remained
here,
but
he
is
in
a
weak
state
as
you
know,"
said
the
old
servant.
Pierre
knew
that
Makar
Alexeevich
was
Joseph
Bazdeev's
half-insane
brother
and
a
hard
drinker.
"Yes,
yes,
I
know.
Let
us
go
in..."
said
Pierre
and
entered
the
house.
A
tall,
bald-headed
old
man
with
a
red
nose,
wearing
a
dressing
gown
and
with
galoshes
on
his
bare
feet,
stood
in
the
anteroom.
On
seeing
Pierre
he
muttered
something
angrily
and
went
away
along
the
passage.
"He
was
a
very
clever
man
but
has
now
grown
quite
feeble,
as
your
honor
sees,"
said
Gerasim.
"Will
you
step
into
the
study?"
Pierre
nodded.
"As
it
was
sealed
up
so
it
has
remained,
but
Sophia
Danilovna
gave
orders
that
if
anyone
should
come
from
you
they
were
to
have
the
books."
Pierre
went
into
that
gloomy
study
which
he
had
entered
with
such
trepidation
in
his
benefactor's
lifetime.
The
room,
dusty
and
untouched
since
the
death
of
Joseph
Bazdeev
was
now
even
gloomier.
Gerasim
opened
one
of
the
shutters
and
left
the
room
on
tiptoe.
Pierre
went
round
the
study,
approached
the
cupboard
in
which
the
manuscripts
were
kept,
and
took
out
what
had
once
been
one
of
the
most
important,
the
holy
of
holies
of
the
order.
This
was
the
authentic
Scotch
Acts
with
Bazdeev's
notes
and
explanations.
He
sat
down
at
the
dusty
writing
table,
and,
having
laid
the
manuscripts
before
him,
opened
them
out,
closed
them,
finally
pushed
them
away,
and
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
sank
into
meditation.
Gerasim
looked
cautiously
into
the
study
several
times
and
saw
Pierre
always
sitting
in
the
same
attitude.
More
than
two
hours
passed
and
Gerasim
took
the
liberty
of
making
a
slight
noise
at
the
door
to
attract
his
attention,
but
Pierre
did
not
hear
him.
"Is
the
cabman
to
be
discharged,
your
honor?"
"Oh
yes!"
said
Pierre,
rousing
himself
and
rising
hurriedly.
"Look
here,"
he
added,
taking
Gerasim
by
a
button
of
his
coat
and
looking
down
at
the
old
man
with
moist,
shining,
and
ecstatic
eyes,
"I
say,
do
you
know
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
battle
tomorrow?"
"We
heard
so,"
replied
the
man.
"I
beg
you
not
to
tell
anyone
who
I
am,
and
to
do
what
I
ask
you."
"Yes,
your
excellency,"
replied
Gerasim.
"Will
you
have
something
to
eat?"
"No,
but
I
want
something
else.
I
want
peasant
clothes
and
a
pistol,"
said
Pierre,
unexpectedly
blushing.
"Yes,
your
excellency,"
said
Gerasim
after
thinking
for
a
moment.
All
the
rest
of
that
day
Pierre
spent
alone
in
his
benefactor's
study,
and
Gerasim
heard
him
pacing
restlessly
from
one
corner
to
another
and
talking
to
himself.
And
he
spent
the
night
on
a
bed
made
up
for
him
there.
Gerasim,
being
a
servant
who
in
his
time
had
seen
many
strange
things,
accepted
Pierre's
taking
up
his
residence
in
the
house
without
surprise,
and
seemed
pleased
to
have
someone
to
wait
on.
That
same
evening--
without
even
asking
himself
what
they
were
wanted
for--he
procured
a
coachman's
coat
and
cap
for
Pierre,
and
promised
to
get
him
the
pistol
next
day.
Makar
Alexeevich
came
twice
that
evening
shuffling
along
in
his
galoshes
as
far
as
the
door
and
stopped
and
looked
ingratiatingly
at
Pierre.
But
as
soon
as
Pierre
turned
toward
him
he
wrapped
his
dressing
gown
around
him
with
a
shamefaced
and
angry
look
and
hurried
away.
It
was
when
Pierre
(wearing
the
coachman's
coat
which
Gerasim
had
procured
for
him
and
had
disinfected
by
steam)
was
on
his
way
with
the
old
man
to
buy
the
pistol
at
the
Sukharev
market
that
he
met
the
Rostovs.
CHAPTER
XIX
Kutuzov's
order
to
retreat
through
Moscow
to
the
Ryazan
road
was
issued
at
night
on
the
first
of
September.
The
first
troops
started
at
once,
and
during
the
night
they
marched
slowly
and
steadily
without
hurry.
At
daybreak,
however,
those
nearing
the
town
at
the
Dorogomilov
bridge
saw
ahead
of
them
masses
of
soldiers
crowding
and
hurrying
across
the
bridge,
ascending
on
the
opposite
side
and
blocking
the
streets
and
alleys,
while
endless
masses
of
troops
were
bearing
down
on
them
from
behind,
and
an
unreasoning
hurry
and
alarm
overcame
them.
They
all
rushed
forward
to
the
bridge,
onto
it,
and
to
the
fords
and
the
boats.
Kutuzov
himself
had
driven
round
by
side
streets
to
the
other
side
of
Moscow.
By
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September,
only
the
rear
guard
remained
in
the
Dorogomilov
suburb,
where
they
had
ample
room.
The
main
army
was
on
the
other
side
of
Moscow
or
beyond
it.
At
that
very
time,
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September,
Napoleon
was
standing
among
his
troops
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
looking
at
the
panorama
spread
out
before
him.
From
the
twenty-sixth
of
August
to
the
second
of
September,
that
is
from
the
battle
of
Borodino
to
the
entry
of
the
French
into
Moscow,
during
the
whole
of
that
agitating,
memorable
week,
there
had
been
the
extraordinary
autumn
weather
that
always
comes
as
a
surprise,
when
the
sun
hangs
low
and
gives
more
heat
than
in
spring,
when
everything
shines
so
brightly
in
the
rare
clear
atmosphere
that
the
eyes
smart,
when
the
lungs
are
strengthened
and
refreshed
by
inhaling
the
aromatic
autumn
air,
when
even
the
nights
are
warm,
and
when
in
those
dark
warm
nights,
golden
stars
startle
and
delight
us
continually
by
falling
from
the
sky.
At
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
second
of
September
this
weather
still
held.
The
brightness
of
the
morning
was
magical.
Moscow
seen
from
the
Poklonny
Hill
lay
spaciously
spread
out
with
her
river,
her
gardens,
and
her
churches,
and
she
seemed
to
be
living
her
usual
life,
her
cupolas
glittering
like
stars
in
the
sunlight.
The
view
of
the
strange
city
with
its
peculiar
architecture,
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before,
filled
Napoleon
with
the
rather
envious
and
uneasy
curiosity
men
feel
when
they
see
an
alien
form
of
life
that
has
no
knowledge
of
them.
This
city
was
evidently
living
with
the
full
force
of
its
own
life.
By
the
indefinite
signs
which,
even
at
a
distance,
distinguish
a
living
body
from
a
dead
one,
Napoleon
from
the
Poklonny
Hill
perceived
the
throb
of
life
in
the
town
and
felt,
as
it
were,
the
breathing
of
that
great
and
beautiful
body.
Every
Russian
looking
at
Moscow
feels
her
to
be
a
mother;
every
foreigner
who
sees
her,
even
if
ignorant
of
her
significance
as
the
mother
city,
must
feel
her
feminine
character,
and
Napoleon
felt
it.
"Cette
ville
asiatique
aux
innombrables
eglises,
Moscou
la
sainte.
La
voila
done
enfin,
cette
fameuse
ville!
Il
etait
temps,"
*
said
he,
and
dismounting
he
ordered
a
plan
of
Moscow
to
be
spread
out
before
him,
and
summoned
Lelorgne
d'Ideville,
the
interpreter.
*
"That
Asiatic
city
of
the
innumerable
churches,
holy
Moscow!
Here
it
is
then
at
last,
that
famous
city.
It
was
high
time."
"A
town
captured
by
the
enemy
is
like
a
maid
who
has
lost
her
honor,"
thought
he
(he
had
said
so
to
Tuchkov
at
Smolensk).
From
that
point
of
view
he
gazed
at
the
Oriental
beauty
he
had
not
seen
before.
It
seemed
strange
to
him
that
his
long-felt
wish,
which
had
seemed
unattainable,
had
at
last
been
realized.
In
the
clear
morning
light
he
gazed
now
at
the
city
and
now
at
the
plan,
considering
its
details,
and
the
assurance
of
possessing
it
agitated
and
awed
him.
"But
could
it
be
otherwise?"
he
thought.
"Here
is
this
capital
at
my
feet.
Where
is
Alexander
now,
and
of
what
is
he
thinking?
A
strange,
beautiful,
and
majestic
city;
and
a
strange
and
majestic
moment!
In
what
light
must
I
appear
to
them!"
thought
he,
thinking
of
his
troops.
"Here
she
is,
the
reward
for
all
those
fainthearted
men,"
he
reflected,
glancing
at
those
near
him
and
at
the
troops
who
were
approaching
and
forming
up.
"One
word
from
me,
one
movement
of
my
hand,
and
that
ancient
capital
of
the
Tsars
would
perish.
But
my
clemency
is
always
ready
to
descend
upon
the
vanquished.
I
must
be
magnanimous
and
truly
great.
But
no,
it
can't
be
true
that
I
am
in
Moscow,"
he
suddenly
thought.
"Yet
here
she
is
lying
at
my
feet,
with
her
golden
domes
and
crosses
scintillating
and
twinkling
in
the
sunshine.
But
I
shall
spare
her.
On
the
ancient
monuments
of
barbarism
and
despotism
I
will
inscribe
great
words
of
justice
and
mercy....
It
is
just
this
which
Alexander
will
feel
most
painfully,
I
know
him."
(It
seemed
to
Napoleon
that
the
chief
import
of
what
was
taking
place
lay
in
the
personal
struggle
between
himself
and
Alexander.)
"From
the
height
of
the
Kremlin--yes,
there
is
the
Kremlin,
yes--I
will
give
them
just
laws;
I
will
teach
them
the
meaning
of
true
civilization,
I
will
make
generations
of
boyars
remember
their
conqueror
with
love.
I
will
tell
the
deputation
that
I
did
not,
and
do
not,
desire
war,
that
I
have
waged
war
only
against
the
false
policy
of
their
court;
that
I
love
and
respect
Alexander
and
that
in
Moscow
I
will
accept
terms
of
peace
worthy
of
myself
and
of
my
people.
I
do
not
wish
to
utilize
the
fortunes
of
war
to
humiliate
an
honored
monarch.
'Boyars,'
I
will
say
to
them,
'I
do
not
desire
war,
I
desire
the
peace
and
welfare
of
all
my
subjects.'
However,
I
know
their
presence
will
inspire
me,
and
I
shall
speak
to
them
as
I
always
do:
clearly,
impressively,
and
majestically.
But
can
it
be
true
that
I
am
in
Moscow?
Yes,
there
she
lies."
"Qu'on
m'amene
les
boyars,"
*
said
he
to
his
suite.
*
"Bring
the
boyars
to
me."
A
general
with
a
brilliant
suite
galloped
off
at
once
to
fetch
the
boyars.
Two
hours
passed.
Napoleon
had
lunched
and
was
again
standing
in
the
same
place
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
awaiting
the
deputation.
His
speech
to
the
boyars
had
already
taken
definite
shape
in
his
imagination.
That
speech
was
full
of
dignity
and
greatness
as
Napoleon
understood
it.
He
was
himself
carried
away
by
the
tone
of
magnanimity
he
intended
to
adopt
toward
Moscow.
In
his
imagination
he
appointed
days
for
assemblies
at
the
palace
of
the
Tsars,
at
which
Russian
notables
and
his
own
would
mingle.
He
mentally
appointed
a
governor,
one
who
would
win
the
hearts
of
the
people.
Having
learned
that
there
were
many
charitable
institutions
in
Moscow
he
mentally
decided
that
he
would
shower
favors
on
them
all.
He
thought
that,
as
in
Africa
he
had
to
put
on
a
burnoose
and
sit
in
a
mosque,
so
in
Moscow
he
must
be
beneficent
like
the
Tsars.
And
in
order
finally
to
touch
the
hearts
of
the
Russians--and
being
like
all
Frenchmen
unable
to
imagine
anything
sentimental
without
a
reference
to
ma
chere,
ma
tendre,
ma
pauvre
mere
*
--he
decided
that
he
would
place
an
inscription
on
all
these
establishments
in
large
letters:
"This
establishment
is
dedicated
to
my
dear
mother."
Or
no,
it
should
be
simply:
Maison
de
ma
Mere,
*(2)
he
concluded.
"But
am
I
really
in
Moscow?
Yes,
here
it
lies
before
me,
but
why
is
the
deputation
from
the
city
so
long
in
appearing?"
he
wondered.
*
"My
dear,
my
tender,
my
poor
mother."
*
(2)
"House
of
my
Mother."
Meanwhile
an
agitated
consultation
was
being
carried
on
in
whispers
among
his
generals
and
marshals
at
the
rear
of
his
suite.
Those
sent
to
fetch
the
deputation
had
returned
with
the
news
that
Moscow
was
empty,
that
everyone
had
left
it.
The
faces
of
those
who
were
not
conferring
together
were
pale
and
perturbed.
They
were
not
alarmed
by
the
fact
that
Moscow
had
been
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
(grave
as
that
fact
seemed),
but
by
the
question
how
to
tell
the
Emperor--without
putting
him
in
the
terrible
position
of
appearing
ridiculous--that
he
had
been
awaiting
the
boyars
so
long
in
vain:
that
there
were
drunken
mobs
left
in
Moscow
but
no
one
else.
Some
said
that
a
deputation
of
some
sort
must
be
scraped
together,
others
disputed
that
opinion
and
maintained
that
the
Emperor
should
first
be
carefully
and
skillfully
prepared,
and
then
told
the
truth.
"He
will
have
to
be
told,
all
the
same,"
said
some
gentlemen
of
the
suite.
"But,
gentlemen..."
The
position
was
the
more
awkward
because
the
Emperor,
meditating
upon
his
magnanimous
plans,
was
pacing
patiently
up
and
down
before
the
outspread
map,
occasionally
glancing
along
the
road
to
Moscow
from
under
his
lifted
hand
with
a
bright
and
proud
smile.
"But
it's
impossible..."
declared
the
gentlemen
of
the
suite,
shrugging
their
shoulders
but
not
venturing
to
utter
the
implied
word--le
ridicule...
At
last
the
Emperor,
tired
of
futile
expectation,
his
actor's
instinct
suggesting
to
him
that
the
sublime
moment
having
been
too
long
drawn
out
was
beginning
to
lose
its
sublimity,
gave
a
sign
with
his
hand.
A
single
report
of
a
signaling
gun
followed,
and
the
troops,
who
were
already
spread
out
on
different
sides
of
Moscow,
moved
into
the
city
through
Tver,
Kaluga,
and
Dorogomilov
gates.
Faster
and
faster,
vying
with
one
another,
they
moved
at
the
double
or
at
a
trot,
vanishing
amid
the
clouds
of
dust
they
raised
and
making
the
air
ring
with
a
deafening
roar
of
mingling
shouts.
Drawn
on
by
the
movement
of
his
troops
Napoleon
rode
with
them
as
far
as
the
Dorogomilov
gate,
but
there
again
stopped
and,
dismounting
from
his
horse,
paced
for
a
long
time
by
the
Kammer-Kollezski
rampart,
awaiting
the
deputation.
CHAPTER
XX
Meanwhile
Moscow
was
empty.
There
were
still
people
in
it,
perhaps
a
fiftieth
part
of
its
former
inhabitants
had
remained,
but
it
was
empty.
It
was
empty
in
the
sense
that
a
dying
queenless
hive
is
empty.
In
a
queenless
hive
no
life
is
left
though
to
a
superficial
glance
it
seems
as
much
alive
as
other
hives.
The
bees
circle
round
a
queenless
hive
in
the
hot
beams
of
the
midday
sun
as
gaily
as
around
the
living
hives;
from
a
distance
it
smells
of
honey
like
the
others,
and
bees
fly
in
and
out
in
the
same
way.
But
one
has
only
to
observe
that
hive
to
realize
that
there
is
no
longer
any
life
in
it.
The
bees
do
not
fly
in
the
same
way,
the
smell
and
the
sound
that
meet
the
beekeeper
are
not
the
same.
To
the
beekeeper's
tap
on
the
wall
of
the
sick
hive,
instead
of
the
former
instant
unanimous
humming
of
tens
of
thousands
of
bees
with
their
abdomens
threateningly
compressed,
and
producing
by
the
rapid
vibration
of
their
wings
an
aerial
living
sound,
the
only
reply
is
a
disconnected
buzzing
from
different
parts
of
the
deserted
hive.
From
the
alighting
board,
instead
of
the
former
spirituous
fragrant
smell
of
honey
and
venom,
and
the
warm
whiffs
of
crowded
life,
comes
an
odor
of
emptiness
and
decay
mingling
with
the
smell
of
honey.
There
are
no
longer
sentinels
sounding
the
alarm
with
their
abdomens
raised,
and
ready
to
die
in
defense
of
the
hive.
There
is
no
longer
the
measured
quiet
sound
of
throbbing
activity,
like
the
sound
of
boiling
water,
but
diverse
discordant
sounds
of
disorder.
In
and
out
of
the
hive
long
black
robber
bees
smeared
with
honey
fly
timidly
and
shiftily.
They
do
not
sting,
but
crawl
away
from
danger.
Formerly
only
bees
laden
with
honey
flew
into
the
hive,
and
they
flew
out
empty;
now
they
fly
out
laden.
The
beekeeper
opens
the
lower
part
of
the
hive
and
peers
in.
Instead
of
black,
glossy
bees--tamed
by
toil,
clinging
to
one
another's
legs
and
drawing
out
the
wax,
with
a
ceaseless
hum
of
labor--that
used
to
hang
in
long
clusters
down
to
the
floor
of
the
hive,
drowsy
shriveled
bees
crawl
about
separately
in
various
directions
on
the
floor
and
walls
of
the
hive.
Instead
of
a
neatly
glued
floor,
swept
by
the
bees
with
the
fanning
of
their
wings,
there
is
a
floor
littered
with
bits
of
wax,
excrement,
dying
bees
scarcely
moving
their
legs,
and
dead
ones
that
have
not
been
cleared
away.
The
beekeeper
opens
the
upper
part
of
the
hive
and
examines
the
super.
Instead
of
serried
rows
of
bees
sealing
up
every
gap
in
the
combs
and
keeping
the
brood
warm,
he
sees
the
skillful
complex
structures
of
the
combs,
but
no
longer
in
their
former
state
of
purity.
All
is
neglected
and
foul.
Black
robber
bees
are
swiftly
and
stealthily
prowling
about
the
combs,
and
the
short
home
bees,
shriveled
and
listless
as
if
they
were
old,
creep
slowly
about
without
trying
to
hinder
the
robbers,
having
lost
all
motive
and
all
sense
of
life.
Drones,
bumblebees,
wasps,
and
butterflies
knock
awkwardly
against
the
walls
of
the
hive
in
their
flight.
Here
and
there
among
the
cells
containing
dead
brood
and
honey
an
angry
buzzing
can
sometimes
be
heard.
Here
and
there
a
couple
of
bees,
by
force
of
habit
and
custom
cleaning
out
the
brood
cells,
with
efforts
beyond
their
strength
laboriously
drag
away
a
dead
bee
or
bumblebee
without
knowing
why
they
do
it.
In
another
corner
two
old
bees
are
languidly
fighting,
or
cleaning
themselves,
or
feeding
one
another,
without
themselves
knowing
whether
they
do
it
with
friendly
or
hostile
intent.
In
a
third
place
a
crowd
of
bees,
crushing
one
another,
attack
some
victim
and
fight
and
smother
it,
and
the
victim,
enfeebled
or
killed,
drops
from
above
slowly
and
lightly
as
a
feather,
among
the
heap
of
corpses.
The
keeper
opens
the
two
center
partitions
to
examine
the
brood
cells.
In
place
of
the
former
close
dark
circles
formed
by
thousands
of
bees
sitting
back
to
back
and
guarding
the
high
mystery
of
generation,
he
sees
hundreds
of
dull,
listless,
and
sleepy
shells
of
bees.
They
have
almost
all
died
unawares,
sitting
in
the
sanctuary
they
had
guarded
and
which
is
now
no
more.
They
reek
of
decay
and
death.
Only
a
few
of
them
still
move,
rise,
and
feebly
fly
to
settle
on
the
enemy's
hand,
lacking
the
spirit
to
die
stinging
him;
the
rest
are
dead
and
fall
as
lightly
as
fish
scales.
The
beekeeper
closes
the
hive,
chalks
a
mark
on
it,
and
when
he
has
time
tears
out
its
contents
and
burns
it
clean.
So
in
the
same
way
Moscow
was
empty
when
Napoleon,
weary,
uneasy,
and
morose,
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
Kammer-Kollezski
rampart,
awaiting
what
to
his
mind
was
a
necessary,
if
but
formal,
observance
of
the
proprieties--a
deputation.
In
various
corners
of
Moscow
there
still
remained
a
few
people
aimlessly
moving
about,
following
their
old
habits
and
hardly
aware
of
what
they
were
doing.
When
with
due
circumspection
Napoleon
was
informed
that
Moscow
was
empty,
he
looked
angrily
at
his
informant,
turned
away,
and
silently
continued
to
walk
to
and
fro.
"My
carriage!"
he
said.
He
took
his
seat
beside
the
aide-de-camp
on
duty
and
drove
into
the
suburb.
"Moscow
deserted!"
he
said
to
himself.
"What
an
incredible
event!"
He
did
not
drive
into
the
town,
but
put
up
at
an
inn
in
the
Dorogomilov
suburb.
The
coup
de
theatre
had
not
come
off.
CHAPTER
XXI
The
Russian
troops
were
passing
through
Moscow
from
two
o'clock
at
night
till
two
in
the
afternoon
and
bore
away
with
them
the
wounded
and
the
last
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
leaving.
The
greatest
crush
during
the
movement
of
the
troops
took
place
at
the
Stone,
Moskva,
and
Yauza
bridges.
While
the
troops,
dividing
into
two
parts
when
passing
around
the
Kremlin,
were
thronging
the
Moskva
and
the
Stone
bridges,
a
great
many
soldiers,
taking
advantage
of
the
stoppage
and
congestion,
turned
back
from
the
bridges
and
slipped
stealthily
and
silently
past
the
church
of
Vasili
the
Beatified
and
under
the
Borovitski
gate,
back
up
the
hill
to
the
Red
Square
where
some
instinct
told
them
they
could
easily
take
things
not
belonging
to
them.
Crowds
of
the
kind
seen
at
cheap
sales
filled
all
the
passages
and
alleys
of
the
Bazaar.
But
there
were
no
dealers
with
voices
of
ingratiating
affability
inviting
customers
to
enter;
there
were
no
hawkers,
nor
the
usual
motley
crowd
of
female
purchasers--but
only
soldiers,
in
uniforms
and
overcoats
though
without
muskets,
entering
the
Bazaar
empty-handed
and
silently
making
their
way
out
through
its
passages
with
bundles.
Tradesmen
and
their
assistants
(of
whom
there
were
but
few)
moved
about
among
the
soldiers
quite
bewildered.
They
unlocked
their
shops
and
locked
them
up
again,
and
themselves
carried
goods
away
with
the
help
of
their
assistants.
On
the
square
in
front
of
the
Bazaar
were
drummers
beating
the
muster
call.
But
the
roll
of
the
drums
did
not
make
the
looting
soldiers
run
in
the
direction
of
the
drum
as
formerly,
but
made
them,
on
the
contrary,
run
farther
away.
Among
the
soldiers
in
the
shops
and
passages
some
men
were
to
be
seen
in
gray
coats,
with
closely
shaven
heads.
Two
officers,
one
with
a
scarf
over
his
uniform
and
mounted
on
a
lean,
dark-gray
horse,
the
other
in
an
overcoat
and
on
foot,
stood
at
the
corner
of
Ilyinka
Street,
talking.
A
third
officer
galloped
up
to
them.
"The
general
orders
them
all
to
be
driven
out
at
once,
without
fail.
This
is
outrageous!
Half
the
men
have
dispersed."
"Where
are
you
off
to?...
Where?..."
he
shouted
to
three
infantrymen
without
muskets
who,
holding
up
the
skirts
of
their
overcoats,
were
slipping
past
him
into
the
Bazaar
passage.
"Stop,
you
rascals!"
"But
how
are
you
going
to
stop
them?"
replied
another
officer.
"There
is
no
getting
them
together.
The
army
should
push
on
before
the
rest
bolt,
that's
all!"
"How
can
one
push
on?
They
are
stuck
there,
wedged
on
the
bridge,
and
don't
move.
Shouldn't
we
put
a
cordon
round
to
prevent
the
rest
from
running
away?"
"Come,
go
in
there
and
drive
them
out!"
shouted
the
senior
officer.
The
officer
in
the
scarf
dismounted,
called
up
a
drummer,
and
went
with
him
into
the
arcade.
Some
soldiers
started
running
away
in
a
group.
A
shopkeeper
with
red
pimples
on
his
cheeks
near
the
nose,
and
a
calm,
persistent,
calculating
expression
on
his
plump
face,
hurriedly
and
ostentatiously
approached
the
officer,
swinging
his
arms.
"Your
honor!"
said
he.
"Be
so
good
as
to
protect
us!
We
won't
grudge
trifles,
you
are
welcome
to
anything--we
shall
be
delighted!
Pray!...
I'll
fetch
a
piece
of
cloth
at
once
for
such
an
honorable
gentleman,
or
even
two
pieces
with
pleasure.
For
we
feel
how
it
is;
but
what's
all
this--sheer
robbery!
If
you
please,
could
not
guards
be
placed
if
only
to
let
us
close
the
shop...."
Several
shopkeepers
crowded
round
the
officer.
"Eh,
what
twaddle!"
said
one
of
them,
a
thin,
stern-looking
man.
"When
one's
head
is
gone
one
doesn't
weep
for
one's
hair!
Take
what
any
of
you
like!"
And
flourishing
his
arm
energetically
he
turned
sideways
to
the
officer.
"It's
all
very
well
for
you,
Ivan
Sidorych,
to
talk,"
said
the
first
tradesman
angrily.
"Please
step
inside,
your
honor!"
"Talk
indeed!"
cried
the
thin
one.
"In
my
three
shops
here
I
have
a
hundred
thousand
rubles'
worth
of
goods.
Can
they
be
saved
when
the
army
has
gone?
Eh,
what
people!
'Against
God's
might
our
hands
can't
fight.'"
"Come
inside,
your
honor!"
repeated
the
tradesman,
bowing.
The
officer
stood
perplexed
and
his
face
showed
indecision.
"It's
not
my
business!"
he
exclaimed,
and
strode
on
quickly
down
one
of
the
passages.
From
one
open
shop
came
the
sound
of
blows
and
vituperation,
and
just
as
the
officer
came
up
to
it
a
man
in
a
gray
coat
with
a
shaven
head
was
flung
out
violently.
This
man,
bent
double,
rushed
past
the
tradesman
and
the
officer.
The
officer
pounced
on
the
soldiers
who
were
in
the
shops,
but
at
that
moment
fearful
screams
reached
them
from
the
huge
crowd
on
the
Moskva
bridge
and
the
officer
ran
out
into
the
square.
"What
is
it?
What
is
it?"
he
asked,
but
his
comrade
was
already
galloping
off
past
Vasili
the
Beatified
in
the
direction
from
which
the
screams
came.
The
officer
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
after
him.
When
he
reached
the
bridge
he
saw
two
unlimbered
guns,
the
infantry
crossing
the
bridge,
several
overturned
carts,
and
frightened
and
laughing
faces
among
the
troops.
Beside
the
cannon
a
cart
was
standing
to
which
two
horses
were
harnessed.
Four
borzois
with
collars
were
pressing
close
to
the
wheels.
The
cart
was
loaded
high,
and
at
the
very
top,
beside
a
child's
chair
with
its
legs
in
the
air,
sat
a
peasant
woman
uttering
piercing
and
desperate
shrieks.
He
was
told
by
his
fellow
officers
that
the
screams
of
the
crowd
and
the
shrieks
of
the
woman
were
due
to
the
fact
that
General
Ermolov,
coming
up
to
the
crowd
and
learning
that
soldiers
were
dispersing
among
the
shops
while
crowds
of
civilians
blocked
the
bridge,
had
ordered
two
guns
to
be
unlimbered
and
made
a
show
of
firing
at
the
bridge.
The
crowd,
crushing
one
another,
upsetting
carts,
and
shouting
and
squeezing
desperately,
had
cleared
off
the
bridge
and
the
troops
were
now
moving
forward.
CHAPTER
XXII
Meanwhile,
the
city
itself
was
deserted.
There
was
hardly
anyone
in
the
streets.
The
gates
and
shops
were
all
closed,
only
here
and
there
round
the
taverns
solitary
shouts
or
drunken
songs
could
be
heard.
Nobody
drove
through
the
streets
and
footsteps
were
rarely
heard.
The
Povarskaya
was
quite
still
and
deserted.
The
huge
courtyard
of
the
Rostovs'
house
was
littered
with
wisps
of
hay
and
with
dung
from
the
horses,
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
there.
In
the
great
drawing
room
of
the
house,
which
had
been
left
with
all
it
contained,
were
two
people.
They
were
the
yard
porter
Ignat,
and
the
page
boy
Mishka,
Vasilich's
grandson
who
had
stayed
in
Moscow
with
his
grandfather.
Mishka
had
opened
the
clavichord
and
was
strumming
on
it
with
one
finger.
The
yard
porter,
his
arms
akimbo,
stood
smiling
with
satisfaction
before
the
large
mirror.
"Isn't
it
fine,
eh,
Uncle
Ignat?"
said
the
boy,
suddenly
beginning
to
strike
the
keyboard
with
both
hands.
"Only
fancy!"
answered
Ignat,
surprised
at
the
broadening
grin
on
his
face
in
the
mirror.
"Impudence!
Impudence!"
they
heard
behind
them
the
voice
of
Mavra
Kuzminichna
who
had
entered
silently.
"How
he's
grinning,
the
fat
mug!
Is
that
what
you're
here
for?
Nothing's
cleared
away
down
there
and
Vasilich
is
worn
out.
Just
you
wait
a
bit!"
Ignat
left
off
smiling,
adjusted
his
belt,
and
went
out
of
the
room
with
meekly
downcast
eyes.
"Aunt,
I
did
it
gently,"
said
the
boy.
"I'll
give
you
something
gently,
you
monkey
you!"
cried
Mavra
Kuzminichna,
raising
her
arm
threateningly.
"Go
and
get
the
samovar
to
boil
for
your
grandfather."
Mavra
Kuzminichna
flicked
the
dust
off
the
clavichord
and
closed
it,
and
with
a
deep
sigh
left
the
drawing
room
and
locked
its
main
door.
Going
out
into
the
yard
she
paused
to
consider
where
she
should
go
next-
-to
drink
tea
in
the
servants'
wing
with
Vasilich,
or
into
the
storeroom
to
put
away
what
still
lay
about.
She
heard
the
sound
of
quick
footsteps
in
the
quiet
street.
Someone
stopped
at
the
gate,
and
the
latch
rattled
as
someone
tried
to
open
it.
Mavra
Kuzminichna
went
to
the
gate.
"Who
do
you
want?"
"The
count--Count
Ilya
Andreevich
Rostov."
"And
who
are
you?"
"An
officer,
I
have
to
see
him,"
came
the
reply
in
a
pleasant,
well-bred
Russian
voice.
Mavra
Kuzminichna
opened
the
gate
and
an
officer
of
eighteen,
with
the
round
face
of
a
Rostov,
entered
the
yard.
"They
have
gone
away,
sir.
Went
away
yesterday
at
vespertime,"
said
Mavra
Kuzminichna
cordially.
The
young
officer
standing
in
the
gateway,
as
if
hesitating
whether
to
enter
or
not,
clicked
his
tongue.
"Ah,
how
annoying!"
he
muttered.
"I
should
have
come
yesterday....
Ah,
what
a
pity."
Meanwhile,
Mavra
Kuzminichna
was
attentively
and
sympathetically
examining
the
familiar
Rostov
features
of
the
young
man's
face,
his
tattered
coat
and
trodden-down
boots.
"What
did
you
want
to
see
the
count
for?"
she
asked.
"Oh
well...
it
can't
be
helped!"
said
he
in
a
tone
of
vexation
and
placed
his
hand
on
the
gate
as
if
to
leave.
He
again
paused
in
indecision.
"You
see,"
he
suddenly
said,
"I
am
a
kinsman
of
the
count's
and
he
has
been
very
kind
to
me.
As
you
see"
(he
glanced
with
an
amused
air
and
good-natured
smile
at
his
coat
and
boots)
"my
things
are
worn
out
and
I
have
no
money,
so
I
was
going
to
ask
the
count..."
Mavra
Kuzminichna
did
not
let
him
finish.
"Just
wait
a
minute,
sir.
One
little
moment,"
said
she.
And
as
soon
as
the
officer
let
go
of
the
gate
handle
she
turned
and,
hurrying
away
on
her
old
legs,
went
through
the
back
yard
to
the
servants'
quarters.
While
Mavra
Kuzminichna
was
running
to
her
room
the
officer
walked
about
the
yard
gazing
at
his
worn-out
boots
with
lowered
head
and
a
faint
smile
on
his
lips.
"What
a
pity
I've
missed
Uncle!
What
a
nice
old
woman!
Where
has
she
run
off
to?
And
how
am
I
to
find
the
nearest
way
to
overtake
my
regiment,
which
must
by
now
be
getting
near
the
Rogozhski
gate?"
thought
he.
Just
then
Mavra
Kuzminichna
appeared
from
behind
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
frightened
yet
resolute
look,
carrying
a
rolled-up
check
kerchief
in
her
hand.
While
still
a
few
steps
from
the
officer
she
unfolded
the
kerchief
and
took
out
of
it
a
white
twenty-
five-ruble
assignat
and
hastily
handed
it
to
him.
"If
his
excellency
had
been
at
home,
as
a
kinsman
he
would
of
course...
but
as
it
is..."
Mavra
Kuzminichna
grew
abashed
and
confused.
The
officer
did
not
decline,
but
took
the
note
quietly
and
thanked
her.
"If
the
count
had
been
at
home..."
Mavra
Kuzminichna
went
on
apologetically.
"Christ
be
with
you,
sir!
May
God
preserve
you!"
said
she,
bowing
as
she
saw
him
out.
Swaying
his
head
and
smiling
as
if
amused
at
himself,
the
officer
ran
almost
at
a
trot
through
the
deserted
streets
toward
the
Yauza
bridge
to
overtake
his
regiment.
But
Mavra
Kuzminichna
stood
at
the
closed
gate
for
some
time
with
moist
eyes,
pensively
swaying
her
head
and
feeling
an
unexpected
flow
of
motherly
tenderness
and
pity
for
the
unknown
young
officer.
CHAPTER
XXIII
From
an
unfinished
house
on
the
Varvarka,
the
ground
floor
of
which
was
a
dramshop,
came
drunken
shouts
and
songs.
On
benches
round
the
tables
in
a
dirty
little
room
sat
some
ten
factory
hands.
Tipsy
and
perspiring,
with
dim
eyes
and
wide-open
mouths,
they
were
all
laboriously
singing
some
song
or
other.
They
were
singing
discordantly,
arduously,
and
with
great
effort,
evidently
not
because
they
wished
to
sing,
but
because
they
wanted
to
show
they
were
drunk
and
on
a
spree.
One,
a
tall,
fair-
haired
lad
in
a
clean
blue
coat,
was
standing
over
the
others.
His
face
with
its
fine
straight
nose
would
have
been
handsome
had
it
not
been
for
his
thin,
compressed,
twitching
lips
and
dull,
gloomy,
fixed
eyes.
Evidently
possessed
by
some
idea,
he
stood
over
those
who
were
singing,
and
solemnly
and
jerkily
flourished
above
their
heads
his
white
arm
with
the
sleeve
turned
up
to
the
elbow,
trying
unnaturally
to
spread
out
his
dirty
fingers.
The
sleeve
of
his
coat
kept
slipping
down
and
he
always
carefully
rolled
it
up
again
with
his
left
hand,
as
if
it
were
most
important
that
the
sinewy
white
arm
he
was
flourishing
should
be
bare.
In
the
midst
of
the
song
cries
were
heard,
and
fighting
and
blows
in
the
passage
and
porch.
The
tall
lad
waved
his
arm.
"Stop
it!"
he
exclaimed
peremptorily.
"There's
a
fight,
lads!"
And,
still
rolling
up
his
sleeve,
he
went
out
to
the
porch.
The
factory
hands
followed
him.
These
men,
who
under
the
leadership
of
the
tall
lad
were
drinking
in
the
dramshop
that
morning,
had
brought
the
publican
some
skins
from
the
factory
and
for
this
had
had
drink
served
them.
The
blacksmiths
from
a
neighboring
smithy,
hearing
the
sounds
of
revelry
in
the
tavern
and
supposing
it
to
have
been
broken
into,
wished
to
force
their
way
in
too
and
a
fight
in
the
porch
had
resulted.
The
publican
was
fighting
one
of
the
smiths
at
the
door,
and
when
the
workmen
came
out
the
smith,
wrenching
himself
free
from
the
tavern
keeper,
fell
face
downward
on
the
pavement.
Another
smith
tried
to
enter
the
doorway,
pressing
against
the
publican
with
his
chest.
The
lad
with
the
turned-up
sleeve
gave
the
smith
a
blow
in
the
face
and
cried
wildly:
"They're
fighting
us,
lads!"
At
that
moment
the
first
smith
got
up
and,
scratching
his
bruised
face
to
make
it
bleed,
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice:
"Police!
Murder!...
They've
killed
a
man,
lads!"
"Oh,
gracious
me,
a
man
beaten
to
death--killed!..."
screamed
a
woman
coming
out
of
a
gate
close
by.
A
crowd
gathered
round
the
bloodstained
smith.
"Haven't
you
robbed
people
enough--taking
their
last
shirts?"
said
a
voice
addressing
the
publican.
"What
have
you
killed
a
man
for,
you
thief?"
The
tall
lad,
standing
in
the
porch,
turned
his
bleared
eyes
from
the
publican
to
the
smith
and
back
again
as
if
considering
whom
he
ought
to
fight
now.
"Murderer!"
he
shouted
suddenly
to
the
publican.
"Bind
him,
lads!"
"I
daresay
you
would
like
to
bind
me!"
shouted
the
publican,
pushing
away
the
men
advancing
on
him,
and
snatching
his
cap
from
his
head
he
flung
it
on
the
ground.
As
if
this
action
had
some
mysterious
and
menacing
significance,
the
workmen
surrounding
the
publican
paused
in
indecision.
"I
know
the
law
very
well,
mates!
I'll
take
the
matter
to
the
captain
of
police.
You
think
I
won't
get
to
him?
Robbery
is
not
permitted
to
anybody
now
a
days!"
shouted
the
publican,
picking
up
his
cap.
"Come
along
then!
Come
along
then!"
the
publican
and
the
tall
young
fellow
repeated
one
after
the
other,
and
they
moved
up
the
street
together.
The
bloodstained
smith
went
beside
them.
The
factory
hands
and
others
followed
behind,
talking
and
shouting.
At
the
corner
of
the
Moroseyka,
opposite
a
large
house
with
closed
shutters
and
bearing
a
bootmaker's
signboard,
stood
a
score
of
thin,
worn-out,
gloomy-faced
bootmakers,
wearing
overalls
and
long
tattered
coats.
"He
should
pay
folks
off
properly,"
a
thin
workingman,
with
frowning
brows
and
a
straggly
beard,
was
saying.
"But
he's
sucked
our
blood
and
now
he
thinks
he's
quit
of
us.
He's
been
misleading
us
all
the
week
and
now
that
he's
brought
us
to
this
pass
he's
made
off."
On
seeing
the
crowd
and
the
bloodstained
man
the
workman
ceased
speaking,
and
with
eager
curiosity
all
the
bootmakers
joined
the
moving
crowd.
"Where
are
all
the
folks
going?"
"Why,
to
the
police,
of
course!"
"I
say,
is
it
true
that
we
have
been
beaten?"
"And
what
did
you
think?
Look
what
folks
are
saying."
Questions
and
answers
were
heard.
The
publican,
taking
advantage
of
the
increased
crowd,
dropped
behind
and
returned
to
his
tavern.
The
tall
youth,
not
noticing
the
disappearance
of
his
foe,
waved
his
bare
arm
and
went
on
talking
incessantly,
attracting
general
attention
to
himself.
It
was
around
him
that
the
people
chiefly
crowded,
expecting
answers
from
him
to
the
questions
that
occupied
all
their
minds.
"He
must
keep
order,
keep
the
law,
that's
what
the
government
is
there
for.
Am
I
not
right,
good
Christians?"
said
the
tall
youth,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile.
"He
thinks
there's
no
government!
How
can
one
do
without
government?
Or
else
there
would
be
plenty
who'd
rob
us."
"Why
talk
nonsense?"
rejoined
voices
in
the
crowd.
"Will
they
give
up
Moscow
like
this?
They
told
you
that
for
fun,
and
you
believed
it!
Aren't
there
plenty
of
troops
on
the
march?
Let
him
in,
indeed!
That's
what
the
government
is
for.
You'd
better
listen
to
what
people
are
saying,"
said
some
of
the
mob
pointing
to
the
tall
youth.
By
the
wall
of
China-Town
a
smaller
group
of
people
were
gathered
round
a
man
in
a
frieze
coat
who
held
a
paper
in
his
hand.
"An
ukase,
they
are
reading
an
ukase!
Reading
an
ukase!"
cried
voices
in
the
crowd,
and
the
people
rushed
toward
the
reader.
The
man
in
the
frieze
coat
was
reading
the
broadsheet
of
August
31.
When
the
crowd
collected
round
him
he
seemed
confused,
but
at
the
demand
of
the
tall
lad
who
had
pushed
his
way
up
to
him,
he
began
in
a
rather
tremulous
voice
to
read
the
sheet
from
the
beginning.
"Early
tomorrow
I
shall
go
to
his
Serene
Highness,"
he
read
("Sirin
Highness,"
said
the
tall
fellow
with
a
triumphant
smile
on
his
lips
and
a
frown
on
his
brow),
"to
consult
with
him
to
act,
and
to
aid
the
army
to
exterminate
these
scoundrels.
We
too
will
take
part..."
the
reader
went
on,
and
then
paused
("Do
you
see,"
shouted
the
youth
victoriously,
"he's
going
to
clear
up
the
whole
affair
for
you...."),
"in
destroying
them,
and
will
send
these
visitors
to
the
devil.
I
will
come
back
to
dinner,
and
we'll
set
to
work.
We
will
do,
completely
do,
and
undo
these
scoundrels."
The
last
words
were
read
out
in
the
midst
of
complete
silence.
The
tall
lad
hung
his
head
gloomily.
It
was
evident
that
no
one
had
understood
the
last
part.
In
particular,
the
words
"I
will
come
back
to
dinner,"
evidently
displeased
both
reader
and
audience.
The
people's
minds
were
tuned
to
a
high
pitch
and
this
was
too
simple
and
needlessly
comprehensible--it
was
what
any
one
of
them
might
have
said
and
therefore
was
what
an
ukase
emanating
from
the
highest
authority
should
not
say.
They
all
stood
despondent
and
silent.
The
tall
youth
moved
his
lips
and
swayed
from
side
to
side.
"We
should
ask
him...
that's
he
himself?"...
"Yes,
ask
him
indeed!...
Why
not?
He'll
explain"...
voices
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd
were
suddenly
heard
saying,
and
the
general
attention
turned
to
the
police
superintendent's
trap
which
drove
into
the
square
attended
by
two
mounted
dragoons.
The
superintendent
of
police,
who
had
gone
that
morning
by
Count
Rostopchin's
orders
to
burn
the
barges
and
had
in
connection
with
that
matter
acquired
a
large
sum
of
money
which
was
at
that
moment
in
his
pocket,
on
seeing
a
crowd
bearing
down
upon
him
told
his
coachman
to
stop.
"What
people
are
these?"
he
shouted
to
the
men,
who
were
moving
singly
and
timidly
in
the
direction
of
his
trap.
"What
people
are
these?"
he
shouted
again,
receiving
no
answer.
"Your
honor..."
replied
the
shopman
in
the
frieze
coat,
"your
honor,
in
accord
with
the
proclamation
of
his
highest
excellency
the
count,
they
desire
to
serve,
not
sparing
their
lives,
and
it
is
not
any
kind
of
riot,
but
as
his
highest
excellence
said..."
"The
count
has
not
left,
he
is
here,
and
an
order
will
be
issued
concerning
you,"
said
the
superintendent
of
police.
"Go
on!"
he
ordered
his
coachman.
The
crowd
halted,
pressing
around
those
who
had
heard
what
the
superintendent
had
said,
and
looking
at
the
departing
trap.
The
superintendent
of
police
turned
round
at
that
moment
with
a
scared
look,
said
something
to
his
coachman,
and
his
horses
increased
their
speed.
"It's
a
fraud,
lads!
Lead
the
way
to
him,
himself!"
shouted
the
tall
youth.
"Don't
let
him
go,
lads!
Let
him
answer
us!
Keep
him!"
shouted
different
people
and
the
people
dashed
in
pursuit
of
the
trap.
Following
the
superintendent
of
police
and
talking
loudly
the
crowd
went
in
the
direction
of
the
Lubyanka
Street.
"There
now,
the
gentry
and
merchants
have
gone
away
and
left
us
to
perish.
Do
they
think
we're
dogs?"
voices
in
the
crowd
were
heard
saying
more
and
more
frequently.
CHAPTER
XXIV
On
the
evening
of
the
first
of
September,
after
his
interview
with
Kutuzov,
Count
Rostopchin
had
returned
to
Moscow
mortified
and
offended
because
he
had
not
been
invited
to
attend
the
council
of
war,
and
because
Kutuzov
had
paid
no
attention
to
his
offer
to
take
part
in
the
defense
of
the
city;
amazed
also
at
the
novel
outlook
revealed
to
him
at
the
camp,
which
treated
the
tranquillity
of
the
capital
and
its
patriotic
fervor
as
not
merely
secondary
but
quite
irrelevant
and
unimportant
matters.
Distressed,
offended,
and
surprised
by
all
this,
Rostopchin
had
returned
to
Moscow.
After
supper
he
lay
down
on
a
sofa
without
undressing,
and
was
awakened
soon
after
midnight
by
a
courier
bringing
him
a
letter
from
Kutuzov.
This
letter
requested
the
count
to
send
police
officers
to
guide
the
troops
through
the
town,
as
the
army
was
retreating
to
the
Ryazan
road
beyond
Moscow.
This
was
not
news
to
Rostopchin.
He
had
known
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned
not
merely
since
his
interview
the
previous
day
with
Kutuzov
on
the
Poklonny
Hill
but
ever
since
the
battle
of
Borodino,
for
all
the
generals
who
came
to
Moscow
after
that
battle
had
said
unanimously
that
it
was
impossible
to
fight
another
battle,
and
since
then
the
government
property
had
been
removed
every
night,
and
half
the
inhabitants
had
left
the
city
with
Rostopchin's
own
permission.
Yet
all
the
same
this
information
astonished
and
irritated
the
count,
coming
as
it
did
in
the
form
of
a
simple
note
with
an
order
from
Kutuzov,
and
received
at
night,
breaking
in
on
his
beauty
sleep.
When
later
on
in
his
memoirs
Count
Rostopchin
explained
his
actions
at
this
time,
he
repeatedly
says
that
he
was
then
actuated
by
two
important
considerations:
to
maintain
tranquillity
in
Moscow
and
expedite
the
departure
of
the
inhabitants.
If
one
accepts
this
twofold
aim
all
Rostopchin's
actions
appear
irreproachable.
"Why
were
the
holy
relics,
the
arms,
ammunition,
gunpowder,
and
stores
of
corn
not
removed?
Why
were
thousands
of
inhabitants
deceived
into
believing
that
Moscow
would
not
be
given
up--and
thereby
ruined?"
"To
preserve
the
tranquillity
of
the
city,"
explains
Count
Rostopchin.
"Why
were
bundles
of
useless
papers
from
the
government
offices,
and
Leppich's
balloon
and
other
articles
removed?"
"To
leave
the
town
empty,"
explains
Count
Rostopchin.
One
need
only
admit
that
public
tranquillity
is
in
danger
and
any
action
finds
a
justification.
All
the
horrors
of
the
reign
of
terror
were
based
only
on
solicitude
for
public
tranquillity.
On
what,
then,
was
Count
Rostopchin's
fear
for
the
tranquillity
of
Moscow
based
in
1812?
What
reason
was
there
for
assuming
any
probability
of
an
uprising
in
the
city?
The
inhabitants
were
leaving
it
and
the
retreating
troops
were
filling
it.
Why
should
that
cause
the
masses
to
riot?
Neither
in
Moscow
nor
anywhere
in
Russia
did
anything
resembling
an
insurrection
ever
occur
when
the
enemy
entered
a
town.
More
than
ten
thousand
people
were
still
in
Moscow
on
the
first
and
second
of
September,
and
except
for
a
mob
in
the
governor's
courtyard,
assembled
there
at
his
bidding,
nothing
happened.
It
is
obvious
that
there
would
have
been
even
less
reason
to
expect
a
disturbance
among
the
people
if
after
the
battle
of
Borodino,
when
the
surrender
of
Moscow
became
certain
or
at
least
probable,
Rostopchin
instead
of
exciting
the
people
by
distributing
arms
and
broadsheets
had
taken
steps
to
remove
all
the
holy
relics,
the
gunpowder,
munitions,
and
money,
and
had
told
the
population
plainly
that
the
town
would
be
abandoned.
Rostopchin,
though
he
had
patriotic
sentiments,
was
a
sanguine
and
impulsive
man
who
had
always
moved
in
the
highest
administrative
circles
and
had
no
understanding
at
all
of
the
people
he
supposed
himself
to
be
guiding.
Ever
since
the
enemy's
entry
into
Smolensk
he
had
in
imagination
been
playing
the
role
of
director
of
the
popular
feeling
of
"the
heart
of
Russia."
Not
only
did
it
seem
to
him
(as
to
all
administrators)
that
he
controlled
the
external
actions
of
Moscow's
inhabitants,
but
he
also
thought
he
controlled
their
mental
attitude
by
means
of
his
broadsheets
and
posters,
written
in
a
coarse
tone
which
the
people
despise
in
their
own
class
and
do
not
understand
from
those
in
authority.
Rostopchin
was
so
pleased
with
the
fine
role
of
leader
of
popular
feeling,
and
had
grown
so
used
to
it,
that
the
necessity
of
relinquishing
that
role
and
abandoning
Moscow
without
any
heroic
display
took
him
unawares
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
ground
slip
away
from
under
his
feet,
so
that
he
positively
did
not
know
what
to
do.
Though
he
knew
it
was
coming,
he
did
not
till
the
last
moment
wholeheartedly
believe
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned,
and
did
not
prepare
for
it.
The
inhabitants
left
against
his
wishes.
If
the
government
offices
were
removed,
this
was
only
done
on
the
demand
of
officials
to
whom
the
count
yielded
reluctantly.
He
was
absorbed
in
the
role
he
had
created
for
himself.
As
is
often
the
case
with
those
gifted
with
an
ardent
imagination,
though
he
had
long
known
that
Moscow
would
be
abandoned
he
knew
it
only
with
his
intellect,
he
did
not
believe
it
in
his
heart
and
did
not
adapt
himself
mentally
to
this
new
position
of
affairs.
All
his
painstaking
and
energetic
activity
(in
how
far
it
was
useful
and
had
any
effect
on
the
people
is
another
question)
had
been
simply
directed
toward
arousing
in
the
masses
his
own
feeling
of
patriotic
hatred
of
the
French.
But
when
events
assumed
their
true
historical
character,
when
expressing
hatred
for
the
French
in
words
proved
insufficient,
when
it
was
not
even
possible
to
express
that
hatred
by
fighting
a
battle,
when
self-
confidence
was
of
no
avail
in
relation
to
the
one
question
before
Moscow,
when
the
whole
population
streamed
out
of
Moscow
as
one
man,
abandoning
their
belongings
and
proving
by
that
negative
action
all
the
depth
of
their
national
feeling,
then
the
role
chosen
by
Rostopchin
suddenly
appeared
senseless.
He
unexpectedly
felt
himself
ridiculous,
weak,
and
alone,
with
no
ground
to
stand
on.
When,
awakened
from
his
sleep,
he
received
that
cold,
peremptory
note
from
Kutuzov,
he
felt
the
more
irritated
the
more
he
felt
himself
to
blame.
All
that
he
had
been
specially
put
in
charge
of,
the
state
property
which
he
should
have
removed,
was
still
in
Moscow
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
take
the
whole
of
it
away.
"Who
is
to
blame
for
it?
Who
has
let
things
come
to
such
a
pass?"
he
ruminated.
"Not
I,
of
course.
I
had
everything
ready.
I
had
Moscow
firmly
in
hand.
And
this
is
what
they
have
let
it
come
to!
Villains!
Traitors!"
he
thought,
without
clearly
defining
who
the
villains
and
traitors
were,
but
feeling
it
necessary
to
hate
those
traitors
whoever
they
might
be
who
were
to
blame
for
the
false
and
ridiculous
position
in
which
he
found
himself.
All
that
night
Count
Rostopchin
issued
orders,
for
which
people
came
to
him
from
all
parts
of
Moscow.
Those
about
him
had
never
seen
the
count
so
morose
and
irritable.
"Your
excellency,
the
Director
of
the
Registrar's
Department
has
sent
for
instructions...
From
the
Consistory,
from
the
Senate,
from
the
University,
from
the
Foundling
Hospital,
the
Suffragan
has
sent...
asking
for
information....
What
are
your
orders
about
the
Fire
Brigade?
From
the
governor
of
the
prison...
from
the
superintendent
of
the
lunatic
asylum..."
All
night
long
such
announcements
were
continually
being
received
by
the
count.
To
all
these
inquiries
he
gave
brief
and
angry
replies
indicating
that
orders
from
him
were
not
now
needed,
that
the
whole
affair,
carefully
prepared
by
him,
had
now
been
ruined
by
somebody,
and
that
that
somebody
would
have
to
bear
the
whole
responsibility
for
all
that
might
happen.
"Oh,
tell
that
blockhead,"
he
said
in
reply
to
the
question
from
the
Registrar's
Department,
"that
he
should
remain
to
guard
his
documents.
Now
why
are
you
asking
silly
questions
about
the
Fire
Brigade?
They
have
horses,
let
them
be
off
to
Vladimir,
and
not
leave
them
to
the
French."
"Your
excellency,
the
superintendent
of
the
lunatic
asylum
has
come:
what
are
your
commands?"
"My
commands?
Let
them
go
away,
that's
all....
And
let
the
lunatics
out
into
the
town.
When
lunatics
command
our
armies
God
evidently
means
these
other
madmen
to
be
free."
In
reply
to
an
inquiry
about
the
convicts
in
the
prison,
Count
Rostopchin
shouted
angrily
at
the
governor:
"Do
you
expect
me
to
give
you
two
battalions--which
we
have
not
got--for
a
convoy?
Release
them,
that's
all
about
it!"
"Your
excellency,
there
are
some
political
prisoners,
Meshkov,
Vereshchagin..."
"Vereshchagin!
Hasn't
he
been
hanged
yet?"
shouted
Rostopchin.
"Bring
him
to
me!"
CHAPTER
XXV
Toward
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning,
when
the
troops
were
already
moving
through
Moscow,
nobody
came
to
the
count
any
more
for
instructions.
Those
who
were
able
to
get
away
were
going
of
their
own
accord,
those
who
remained
behind
decided
for
themselves
what
they
must
do.
The
count
ordered
his
carriage
that
he
might
drive
to
Sokolniki,
and
sat
in
his
study
with
folded
hands,
morose,
sallow,
and
taciturn.
In
quiet
and
untroubled
times
it
seems
to
every
administrator
that
it
is
only
by
his
efforts
that
the
whole
population
under
his
rule
is
kept
going,
and
in
this
consciousness
of
being
indispensable
every
administrator
finds
the
chief
reward
of
his
labor
and
efforts.
While
the
sea
of
history
remains
calm
the
ruler-administrator
in
his
frail
bark,
holding
on
with
a
boat
hook
to
the
ship
of
the
people
and
himself
moving,
naturally
imagines
that
his
efforts
move
the
ship
he
is
holding
on
to.
But
as
soon
as
a
storm
arises
and
the
sea
begins
to
heave
and
the
ship
to
move,
such
a
delusion
is
no
longer
possible.
The
ship
moves
independently
with
its
own
enormous
motion,
the
boat
hook
no
longer
reaches
the
moving
vessel,
and
suddenly
the
administrator,
instead
of
appearing
a
ruler
and
a
source
of
power,
becomes
an
insignificant,
useless,
feeble
man.
Rostopchin
felt
this,
and
it
was
this
which
exasperated
him.
The
superintendent
of
police,
whom
the
crowd
had
stopped,
went
in
to
see
him
at
the
same
time
as
an
adjutant
who
informed
the
count
that
the
horses
were
harnessed.
They
were
both
pale,
and
the
superintendent
of
police,
after
reporting
that
he
had
executed
the
instructions
he
had
received,
informed
the
count
that
an
immense
crowd
had
collected
in
the
courtyard
and
wished
to
see
him.
Without
saying
a
word
Rostopchin
rose
and
walked
hastily
to
his
light,
luxurious
drawing
room,
went
to
the
balcony
door,
took
hold
of
the
handle,
let
it
go
again,
and
went
to
the
window
from
which
he
had
a
better
view
of
the
whole
crowd.
The
tall
lad
was
standing
in
front,
flourishing
his
arm
and
saying
something
with
a
stern
look.
The
blood-
stained
smith
stood
beside
him
with
a
gloomy
face.
A
drone
of
voices
was
audible
through
the
closed
window.
"Is
my
carriage
ready?"
asked
Rostopchin,
stepping
back
from
the
window.
"It
is,
your
excellency,"
replied
the
adjutant.
Rostopchin
went
again
to
the
balcony
door.
"But
what
do
they
want?"
he
asked
the
superintendent
of
police.
"Your
excellency,
they
say
they
have
got
ready,
according
to
your
orders,
to
go
against
the
French,
and
they
shouted
something
about
treachery.
But
it
is
a
turbulent
crowd,
your
excellency--I
hardly
managed
to
get
away
from
it.
Your
excellency,
I
venture
to
suggest..."
"You
may
go.
I
don't
need
you
to
tell
me
what
to
do!"
exclaimed
Rostopchin
angrily.
He
stood
by
the
balcony
door
looking
at
the
crowd.
"This
is
what
they
have
done
with
Russia!
This
is
what
they
have
done
with
me!"
thought
he,
full
of
an
irrepressible
fury
that
welled
up
within
him
against
the
someone
to
whom
what
was
happening
might
be
attributed.
As
often
happens
with
passionate
people,
he
was
mastered
by
anger
but
was
still
seeking
an
object
on
which
to
vent
it.
"Here
is
that
mob,
the
dregs
of
the
people,"
he
thought
as
he
gazed
at
the
crowd:
"this
rabble
they
have
roused
by
their
folly!
They
want
a
victim,"
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
the
tall
lad
flourishing
his
arm.
And
this
thought
occurred
to
him
just
because
he
himself
desired
a
victim,
something
on
which
to
vent
his
rage.
"Is
the
carriage
ready?"
he
asked
again.
"Yes,
your
excellency.
What
are
your
orders
about
Vereshchagin?
He
is
waiting
at
the
porch,"
said
the
adjutant.
"Ah!"
exclaimed
Rostopchin,
as
if
struck
by
an
unexpected
recollection.
And
rapidly
opening
the
door
he
went
resolutely
out
onto
the
balcony.
The
talking
instantly
ceased,
hats
and
caps
were
doffed,
and
all
eyes
were
raised
to
the
count.
"Good
morning,
lads!"
said
the
count
briskly
and
loudly.
"Thank
you
for
coming.
I'll
come
out
to
you
in
a
moment,
but
we
must
first
settle
with
the
villain.
We
must
punish
the
villain
who
has
caused
the
ruin
of
Moscow.
Wait
for
me!"
And
the
count
stepped
as
briskly
back
into
the
room
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him.
A
murmur
of
approbation
and
satisfaction
ran
through
the
crowd.
"He'll
settle
with
all
the
villains,
you'll
see!
And
you
said
the
French...
He'll
show
you
what
law
is!"
the
mob
were
saying
as
if
reproving
one
another
for
their
lack
of
confidence.
A
few
minutes
later
an
officer
came
hurriedly
out
of
the
front
door,
gave
an
order,
and
the
dragoons
formed
up
in
line.
The
crowd
moved
eagerly
from
the
balcony
toward
the
porch.
Rostopchin,
coming
out
there
with
quick
angry
steps,
looked
hastily
around
as
if
seeking
someone.
"Where
is
he?"
he
inquired.
And
as
he
spoke
he
saw
a
young
man
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
house
between
two
dragoons.
He
had
a
long
thin
neck,
and
his
head,
that
had
been
half
shaved,
was
again
covered
by
short
hair.
This
young
man
was
dressed
in
a
threadbare
blue
cloth
coat
lined
with
fox
fur,
that
had
once
been
smart,
and
dirty
hempen
convict
trousers,
over
which
were
pulled
his
thin,
dirty,
trodden-down
boots.
On
his
thin,
weak
legs
were
heavy
chains
which
hampered
his
irresolute
movements.
"Ah!"
said
Rostopchin,
hurriedly
turning
away
his
eyes
from
the
young
man
in
the
fur-lined
coat
and
pointing
to
the
bottom
step
of
the
porch.
"Put
him
there."
The
young
man
in
his
clattering
chains
stepped
clumsily
to
the
spot
indicated,
holding
away
with
one
finger
the
coat
collar
which
chafed
his
neck,
turned
his
long
neck
twice
this
way
and
that,
sighed,
and
submissively
folded
before
him
his
thin
hands,
unused
to
work.
For
several
seconds
while
the
young
man
was
taking
his
place
on
the
step
the
silence
continued.
Only
among
the
back
rows
of
the
people,
who
were
all
pressing
toward
the
one
spot,
could
sighs,
groans,
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
be
heard.
While
waiting
for
the
young
man
to
take
his
place
on
the
step
Rostopchin
stood
frowning
and
rubbing
his
face
with
his
hand.
"Lads!"
said
he,
with
a
metallic
ring
in
his
voice.
"This
man,
Vereshchagin,
is
the
scoundrel
by
whose
doing
Moscow
is
perishing."
The
young
man
in
the
fur-lined
coat,
stooping
a
little,
stood
in
a
submissive
attitude,
his
fingers
clasped
before
him.
His
emaciated
young
face,
disfigured
by
the
half-shaven
head,
hung
down
hopelessly.
At
the
count's
first
words
he
raised
it
slowly
and
looked
up
at
him
as
if
wishing
to
say
something
or
at
least
to
meet
his
eye.
But
Rostopchin
did
not
look
at
him.
A
vein
in
the
young
man's
long
thin
neck
swelled
like
a
cord
and
went
blue
behind
the
ear,
and
suddenly
his
face
flushed.
All
eyes
were
fixed
on
him.
He
looked
at
the
crowd,
and
rendered
more
hopeful
by
the
expression
he
read
on
the
faces
there,
he
smiled
sadly
and
timidly,
and
lowering
his
head
shifted
his
feet
on
the
step.
"He
has
betrayed
his
Tsar
and
his
country,
he
has
gone
over
to
Bonaparte.
He
alone
of
all
the
Russians
has
disgraced
the
Russian
name,
he
has
caused
Moscow
to
perish,"
said
Rostopchin
in
a
sharp,
even
voice,
but
suddenly
he
glanced
down
at
Vereshchagin
who
continued
to
stand
in
the
same
submissive
attitude.
As
if
inflamed
by
the
sight,
he
raised
his
arm
and
addressed
the
people,
almost
shouting:
"Deal
with
him
as
you
think
fit!
I
hand
him
over
to
you."
The
crowd
remained
silent
and
only
pressed
closer
and
closer
to
one
another.
To
keep
one
another
back,
to
breathe
in
that
stifling
atmosphere,
to
be
unable
to
stir,
and
to
await
something
unknown,
uncomprehended,
and
terrible,
was
becoming
unbearable.
Those
standing
in
front,
who
had
seen
and
heard
what
had
taken
place
before
them,
all
stood
with
wide-open
eyes
and
mouths,
straining
with
all
their
strength,
and
held
back
the
crowd
that
was
pushing
behind
them.
"Beat
him!...
Let
the
traitor
perish
and
not
disgrace
the
Russian
name!"
shouted
Rostopchin.
"Cut
him
down.
I
command
it."
Hearing
not
so
much
the
words
as
the
angry
tone
of
Rostopchin's
voice,
the
crowd
moaned
and
heaved
forward,
but
again
paused.
"Count!"
exclaimed
the
timid
yet
theatrical
voice
of
Vereshchagin
in
the
midst
of
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued,
"Count!
One
God
is
above
us
both...."
He
lifted
his
head
and
again
the
thick
vein
in
his
thin
neck
filled
with
blood
and
the
color
rapidly
came
and
went
in
his
face.
He
did
not
finish
what
he
wished
to
say.
"Cut
him
down!
I
command
it..."
shouted
Rostopchin,
suddenly
growing
pale
like
Vereshchagin.
"Draw
sabers!"
cried
the
dragoon
officer,
drawing
his
own.
Another
still
stronger
wave
flowed
through
the
crowd
and
reaching
the
front
ranks
carried
it
swaying
to
the
very
steps
of
the
porch.
The
tall
youth,
with
a
stony
look
on
his
face,
and
rigid
and
uplifted
arm,
stood
beside
Vereshchagin.
"Saber
him!"
the
dragoon
officer
almost
whispered.
And
one
of
the
soldiers,
his
face
all
at
once
distorted
with
fury,
struck
Vereshchagin
on
the
head
with
the
blunt
side
of
his
saber.
"Ah!"
cried
Vereshchagin
in
meek
surprise,
looking
round
with
a
frightened
glance
as
if
not
understanding
why
this
was
done
to
him.
A
similar
moan
of
surprise
and
horror
ran
through
the
crowd.
"O
Lord!"
exclaimed
a
sorrowful
voice.
But
after
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
had
escaped
from
Vereshchagin
he
uttered
a
plaintive
cry
of
pain,
and
that
cry
was
fatal.
The
barrier
of
human
feeling,
strained
to
the
utmost,
that
had
held
the
crowd
in
check
suddenly
broke.
The
crime
had
begun
and
must
now
be
completed.
The
plaintive
moan
of
reproach
was
drowned
by
the
threatening
and
angry
roar
of
the
crowd.
Like
the
seventh
and
last
wave
that
shatters
a
ship,
that
last
irresistible
wave
burst
from
the
rear
and
reached
the
front
ranks,
carrying
them
off
their
feet
and
engulfing
them
all.
The
dragoon
was
about
to
repeat
his
blow.
Vereshchagin
with
a
cry
of
horror,
covering
his
head
with
his
hands,
rushed
toward
the
crowd.
The
tall
youth,
against
whom
he
stumbled,
seized
his
thin
neck
with
his
hands
and,
yelling
wildly,
fell
with
him
under
the
feet
of
the
pressing,
struggling
crowd.
Some
beat
and
tore
at
Vereshchagin,
others
at
the
tall
youth.
And
the
screams
of
those
that
were
being
trampled
on
and
of
those
who
tried
to
rescue
the
tall
lad
only
increased
the
fury
of
the
crowd.
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
dragoons
could
extricate
the
bleeding
youth,
beaten
almost
to
death.
And
for
a
long
time,
despite
the
feverish
haste
with
which
the
mob
tried
to
end
the
work
that
had
been
begun,
those
who
were
hitting,
throttling,
and
tearing
at
Vereshchagin
were
unable
to
kill
him,
for
the
crowd
pressed
from
all
sides,
swaying
as
one
mass
with
them
in
the
center
and
rendering
it
impossible
for
them
either
to
kill
him
or
let
him
go.
"Hit
him
with
an
ax,
eh!...
Crushed?...
Traitor,
he
sold
Christ....
Still
alive...
tenacious...
serves
him
right!
Torture
serves
a
thief
right.
Use
the
hatchet!...
What--still
alive?"
Only
when
the
victim
ceased
to
struggle
and
his
cries
changed
to
a
long-
drawn,
measured
death
rattle
did
the
crowd
around
his
prostrate,
bleeding
corpse
begin
rapidly
to
change
places.
Each
one
came
up,
glanced
at
what
had
been
done,
and
with
horror,
reproach,
and
astonishment
pushed
back
again.
"O
Lord!
The
people
are
like
wild
beasts!
How
could
he
be
alive?"
voices
in
the
crowd
could
be
heard
saying.
"Quite
a
young
fellow
too...
must
have
been
a
merchant's
son.
What
men!...
and
they
say
he's
not
the
right
one....
How
not
the
right
one?...
O
Lord!
And
there's
another
has
been
beaten
too--they
say
he's
nearly
done
for....
Oh,
the
people...
Aren't
they
afraid
of
sinning?..."
said
the
same
mob
now,
looking
with
pained
distress
at
the
dead
body
with
its
long,
thin,
half-severed
neck
and
its
livid
face
stained
with
blood
and
dust.
A
painstaking
police
officer,
considering
the
presence
of
a
corpse
in
his
excellency's
courtyard
unseemly,
told
the
dragoons
to
take
it
away.
Two
dragoons
took
it
by
its
distorted
legs
and
dragged
it
along
the
ground.
The
gory,
dust-stained,
half-shaven
head
with
its
long
neck
trailed
twisting
along
the
ground.
The
crowd
shrank
back
from
it.
At
the
moment
when
Vereshchagin
fell
and
the
crowd
closed
in
with
savage
yells
and
swayed
about
him,
Rostopchin
suddenly
turned
pale
and,
instead
of
going
to
the
back
entrance
where
his
carriage
awaited
him,
went
with
hurried
steps
and
bent
head,
not
knowing
where
and
why,
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor.
The
count's
face
was
white
and
he
could
not
control
the
feverish
twitching
of
his
lower
jaw.
"This
way,
your
excellency...
Where
are
you
going?...
This
way,
please..."
said
a
trembling,
frightened
voice
behind
him.
Count
Rostopchin
was
unable
to
reply
and,
turning
obediently,
went
in
the
direction
indicated.
At
the
back
entrance
stood
his
caleche.
The
distant
roar
of
the
yelling
crowd
was
audible
even
there.
He
hastily
took
his
seat
and
told
the
coachman
to
drive
him
to
his
country
house
in
Sokolniki.
When
they
reached
the
Myasnitski
Street
and
could
no
longer
hear
the
shouts
of
the
mob,
the
count
began
to
repent.
He
remembered
with
dissatisfaction
the
agitation
and
fear
he
had
betrayed
before
his
subordinates.
"The
mob
is
terrible--disgusting,"
he
said
to
himself
in
French.
"They
are
like
wolves
whom
nothing
but
flesh
can
appease."
"Count!
One
God
is
above
us
both!"--Vereshchagin's
words
suddenly
recurred
to
him,
and
a
disagreeable
shiver
ran
down
his
back.
But
this
was
only
a
momentary
feeling
and
Count
Rostopchin
smiled
disdainfully
at
himself.
"I
had
other
duties,"
thought
he.
"The
people
had
to
be
appeased.
Many
other
victims
have
perished
and
are
perishing
for
the
public
good"--and
he
began
thinking
of
his
social
duties
to
his
family
and
to
the
city
entrusted
to
him,
and
of
himself--not
himself
as
Theodore
Vasilyevich
Rostopchin
(he
fancied
that
Theodore
Vasilyevich
Rostopchin
was
sacrificing
himself
for
the
public
good)
but
himself
as
governor,
the
representative
of
authority
and
of
the
Tsar.
"Had
I
been
simply
Theodore
Vasilyevich
my
course
of
action
would
have
been
quite
different,
but
it
was
my
duty
to
safeguard
my
life
and
dignity
as
commander-in-chief."
Lightly
swaying
on
the
flexible
springs
of
his
carriage
and
no
longer
hearing
the
terrible
sounds
of
the
crowd,
Rostopchin
grew
physically
calm
and,
as
always
happens,
as
soon
as
he
became
physically
tranquil
his
mind
devised
reasons
why
he
should
be
mentally
tranquil
too.
The
thought
which
tranquillized
Rostopchin
was
not
a
new
one.
Since
the
world
began
and
men
have
killed
one
another
no
one
has
ever
committed
such
a
crime
against
his
fellow
man
without
comforting
himself
with
this
same
idea.
This
idea
is
le
bien
public,
the
hypothetical
welfare
of
other
people.
To
a
man
not
swayed
by
passion
that
welfare
is
never
certain,
but
he
who
commits
such
a
crime
always
knows
just
where
that
welfare
lies.
And
Rostopchin
now
knew
it.
Not
only
did
his
reason
not
reproach
him
for
what
he
had
done,
but
he
even
found
cause
for
self-satisfaction
in
having
so
successfully
contrived
to
avail
himself
of
a
convenient
opportunity
to
punish
a
criminal
and
at
the
same
time
pacify
the
mob.
"Vereshchagin
was
tried
and
condemned
to
death,"
thought
Rostopchin
(though
the
Senate
had
only
condemned
Vereshchagin
to
hard
labor),
"he
was
a
traitor
and
a
spy.
I
could
not
let
him
go
unpunished
and
so
I
have
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone:
to
appease
the
mob
I
gave
them
a
victim
and
at
the
same
time
punished
a
miscreant."
Having
reached
his
country
house
and
begun
to
give
orders
about
domestic
arrangements,
the
count
grew
quite
tranquil.
Half
an
hour
later
he
was
driving
with
his
fast
horses
across
the
Sokolniki
field,
no
longer
thinking
of
what
had
occurred
but
considering
what
was
to
come.
He
was
driving
to
the
Yauza
bridge
where
he
had
heard
that
Kutuzov
was.
Count
Rostopchin
was
mentally
preparing
the
angry
and
stinging
reproaches
he
meant
to
address
to
Kutuzov
for
his
deception.
He
would
make
that
foxy
old
courtier
feel
that
the
responsibility
for
all
the
calamities
that
would
follow
the
abandonment
of
the
city
and
the
ruin
of
Russia
(as
Rostopchin
regarded
it)
would
fall
upon
his
doting
old
head.
Planning
beforehand
what
he
would
say
to
Kutuzov,
Rostopchin
turned
angrily
in
his
caleche
and
gazed
sternly
from
side
to
side.
The
Sokolniki
field
was
deserted.
Only
at
the
end
of
it,
in
front
of
the
almshouse
and
the
lunatic
asylum,
could
be
seen
some
people
in
white
and
others
like
them
walking
singly
across
the
field
shouting
and
gesticulating.
One
of
these
was
running
to
cross
the
path
of
Count
Rostopchin's
carriage,
and
the
count
himself,
his
coachman,
and
his
dragoons
looked
with
vague
horror
and
curiosity
at
these
released
lunatics
and
especially
at
the
one
running
toward
them.
Swaying
from
side
to
side
on
his
long,
thin
legs
in
his
fluttering
dressing
gown,
this
lunatic
was
running
impetuously,
his
gaze
fixed
on
Rostopchin,
shouting
something
in
a
hoarse
voice
and
making
signs
to
him
to
stop.
The
lunatic's
solemn,
gloomy
face
was
thin
and
yellow,
with
its
beard
growing
in
uneven
tufts.
His
black,
agate
pupils
with
saffron-
yellow
whites
moved
restlessly
near
the
lower
eyelids.
"Stop!
Pull
up,
I
tell
you!"
he
cried
in
a
piercing
voice,
and
again
shouted
something
breathlessly
with
emphatic
intonations
and
gestures.
Coming
abreast
of
the
caleche
he
ran
beside
it.
"Thrice
have
they
slain
me,
thrice
have
I
risen
from
the
dead.
They
stoned
me,
crucified
me...
I
shall
rise...
shall
rise...
shall
rise.
They
have
torn
my
body.
The
kingdom
of
God
will
be
overthrown...
Thrice
will
I
overthrow
it
and
thrice
re-establish
it!"
he
cried,
raising
his
voice
higher
and
higher.
Count
Rostopchin
suddenly
grew
pale
as
he
had
done
when
the
crowd
closed
in
on
Vereshchagin.
He
turned
away.
"Go
fas...
faster!"
he
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
to
his
coachman.
The
caleche
flew
over
the
ground
as
fast
as
the
horses
could
draw
it,
but
for
a
long
time
Count
Rostopchin
still
heard
the
insane
despairing
screams
growing
fainter
in
the
distance,
while
his
eyes
saw
nothing
but
the
astonished,
frightened,
bloodstained
face
of
"the
traitor"
in
the
fur-lined
coat.
Recent
as
that
mental
picture
was,
Rostopchin
already
felt
that
it
had
cut
deep
into
his
heart
and
drawn
blood.
Even
now
he
felt
clearly
that
the
gory
trace
of
that
recollection
would
not
pass
with
time,
but
that
the
terrible
memory
would,
on
the
contrary,
dwell
in
his
heart
ever
more
cruelly
and
painfully
to
the
end
of
his
life.
He
seemed
still
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
words:
"Cut
him
down!
I
command
it...."
"Why
did
I
utter
those
words?
It
was
by
some
accident
I
said
them....
I
need
not
have
said
them,"
he
thought.
"And
then
nothing
would
have
happened."
He
saw
the
frightened
and
then
infuriated
face
of
the
dragoon
who
dealt
the
blow,
the
look
of
silent,
timid
reproach
that
boy
in
the
fur-lined
coat
had
turned
upon
him.
"But
I
did
not
do
it
for
my
own
sake.
I
was
bound
to
act
that
way....
The
mob,
the
traitor...
the
public
welfare,"
thought
he.
Troops
were
still
crowding
at
the
Yauza
bridge.
It
was
hot.
Kutuzov,
dejected
and
frowning,
sat
on
a
bench
by
the
bridge
toying
with
his
whip
in
the
sand
when
a
caleche
dashed
up
noisily.
A
man
in
a
general's
uniform
with
plumes
in
his
hat
went
up
to
Kutuzov
and
said
something
in
French.
It
was
Count
Rostopchin.
He
told
Kutuzov
that
he
had
come
because
Moscow,
the
capital,
was
no
more
and
only
the
army
remained.
"Things
would
have
been
different
if
your
Serene
Highness
had
not
told
me
that
you
would
not
abandon
Moscow
without
another
battle;
all
this
would
not
have
happened,"
he
said.
Kutuzov
looked
at
Rostopchin
as
if,
not
grasping
what
was
said
to
him,
he
was
trying
to
read
something
peculiar
written
at
that
moment
on
the
face
of
the
man
addressing
him.
Rostopchin
grew
confused
and
became
silent.
Kutuzov
slightly
shook
his
head
and
not
taking
his
penetrating
gaze
from
Rostopchin's
face
muttered
softly:
"No!
I
shall
not
give
up
Moscow
without
a
battle!"
Whether
Kutuzov
was
thinking
of
something
entirely
different
when
he
spoke
those
words,
or
uttered
them
purposely,
knowing
them
to
be
meaningless,
at
any
rate
Rostopchin
made
no
reply
and
hastily
left
him.
And
strange
to
say,
the
Governor
of
Moscow,
the
proud
Count
Rostopchin,
took
up
a
Cossack
whip
and
went
to
the
bridge
where
he
began
with
shouts
to
drive
on
the
carts
that
blocked
the
way.
CHAPTER
XXVI
Toward
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
Murat's
troops
were
entering
Moscow.
In
front
rode
a
detachment
of
Wurttemberg
hussars
and
behind
them
rode
the
King
of
Naples
himself
accompanied
by
a
numerous
suite.
About
the
middle
of
the
Arbat
Street,
near
the
Church
of
the
Miraculous
Icon
of
St.
Nicholas,
Murat
halted
to
await
news
from
the
advanced
detachment
as
to
the
condition
in
which
they
had
found
the
citadel,
le
Kremlin.
Around
Murat
gathered
a
group
of
those
who
had
remained
in
Moscow.
They
all
stared
in
timid
bewilderment
at
the
strange,
long-haired
commander
dressed
up
in
feathers
and
gold.
"Is
that
their
Tsar
himself?
He's
not
bad!"
low
voices
could
be
heard
saying.
An
interpreter
rode
up
to
the
group.
"Take
off
your
cap...
your
caps!"
These
words
went
from
one
to
another
in
the
crowd.
The
interpreter
addressed
an
old
porter
and
asked
if
it
was
far
to
the
Kremlin.
The
porter,
listening
in
perplexity
to
the
unfamiliar
Polish
accent
and
not
realizing
that
the
interpreter
was
speaking
Russian,
did
not
understand
what
was
being
said
to
him
and
slipped
behind
the
others.
Murat
approached
the
interpreter
and
told
him
to
ask
where
the
Russian
army
was.
One
of
the
Russians
understood
what
was
asked
and
several
voices
at
once
began
answering
the
interpreter.
A
French
officer,
returning
from
the
advanced
detachment,
rode
up
to
Murat
and
reported
that
the
gates
of
the
citadel
had
been
barricaded
and
that
there
was
probably
an
ambuscade
there.
"Good!"
said
Murat
and,
turning
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
in
his
suite,
ordered
four
light
guns
to
be
moved
forward
to
fire
at
the
gates.
The
guns
emerged
at
a
trot
from
the
column
following
Murat
and
advanced
up
the
Arbat.
When
they
reached
the
end
of
the
Vozdvizhenka
Street
they
halted
and
drew
in
the
Square.
Several
French
officers
superintended
the
placing
of
the
guns
and
looked
at
the
Kremlin
through
field
glasses.
The
bells
in
the
Kremlin
were
ringing
for
vespers,
and
this
sound
troubled
the
French.
They
imagined
it
to
be
a
call
to
arms.
A
few
infantrymen
ran
to
the
Kutafyev
Gate.
Beams
and
wooden
screens
had
been
put
there,
and
two
musket
shots
rang
out
from
under
the
gate
as
soon
as
an
officer
and
men
began
to
run
toward
it.
A
general
who
was
standing
by
the
guns
shouted
some
words
of
command
to
the
officer,
and
the
latter
ran
back
again
with
his
men.
The
sound
of
three
more
shots
came
from
the
gate.
One
shot
struck
a
French
soldier's
foot,
and
from
behind
the
screens
came
the
strange
sound
of
a
few
voices
shouting.
Instantly
as
at
a
word
of
command
the
expression
of
cheerful
serenity
on
the
faces
of
the
French
general,
officers,
and
men
changed
to
one
of
determined
concentrated
readiness
for
strife
and
suffering.
To
all
of
them
from
the
marshal
to
the
least
soldier,
that
place
was
not
the
Vozdvizhenka,
Mokhavaya,
or
Kutafyev
Street,
nor
the
Troitsa
Gate
(places
familiar
in
Moscow),
but
a
new
battlefield
which
would
probably
prove
sanguinary.
And
all
made
ready
for
that
battle.
The
cries
from
the
gates
ceased.
The
guns
were
advanced,
the
artillerymen
blew
the
ash
off
their
linstocks,
and
an
officer
gave
the
word
"Fire!"
This
was
followed
by
two
whistling
sounds
of
canister
shot,
one
after
another.
The
shot
rattled
against
the
stone
of
the
gate
and
upon
the
wooden
beams
and
screens,
and
two
wavering
clouds
of
smoke
rose
over
the
Square.
A
few
instants
after
the
echo
of
the
reports
resounding
over
the
stone-
built
Kremlin
had
died
away
the
French
heard
a
strange
sound
above
their
head.
Thousands
of
crows
rose
above
the
walls
and
circled
in
the
air,
cawing
and
noisily
flapping
their
wings.
Together
with
that
sound
came
a
solitary
human
cry
from
the
gateway
and
amid
the
smoke
appeared
the
figure
of
a
bareheaded
man
in
a
peasant's
coat.
He
grasped
a
musket
and
took
aim
at
the
French.
"Fire!"
repeated
the
officer
once
more,
and
the
reports
of
a
musket
and
of
two
cannon
shots
were
heard
simultaneously.
The
gate
was
again
hidden
by
smoke.
Nothing
more
stirred
behind
the
screens
and
the
French
infantry
soldiers
and
officers
advanced
to
the
gate.
In
the
gateway
lay
three
wounded
and
four
dead.
Two
men
in
peasant
coats
ran
away
at
the
foot
of
the
wall,
toward
the
Znamenka.
"Clear
that
away!"
said
the
officer,
pointing
to
the
beams
and
the
corpses,
and
the
French
soldiers,
after
dispatching
the
wounded,
threw
the
corpses
over
the
parapet.
Who
these
men
were
nobody
knew.
"Clear
that
away!"
was
all
that
was
said
of
them,
and
they
were
thrown
over
the
parapet
and
removed
later
on
that
they
might
not
stink.
Thiers
alone
dedicates
a
few
eloquent
lines
to
their
memory:
"These
wretches
had
occupied
the
sacred
citadel,
having
supplied
themselves
with
guns
from
the
arsenal,
and
fired"
(the
wretches)
"at
the
French.
Some
of
them
were
sabered
and
the
Kremlin
was
purged
of
their
presence."
Murat
was
informed
that
the
way
had
been
cleared.
The
French
entered
the
gates
and
began
pitching
their
camp
in
the
Senate
Square.
Out
of
the
windows
of
the
Senate
House
the
soldiers
threw
chairs
into
the
Square
for
fuel
and
kindled
fires
there.
Other
detachments
passed
through
the
Kremlin
and
encamped
along
the
Moroseyka,
the
Lubyanka,
and
Pokrovka
Streets.
Others
quartered
themselves
along
the
Vozdvizhenka,
the
Nikolski,
and
the
Tverskoy
Streets.
No
masters
of
the
houses
being
found
anywhere,
the
French
were
not
billeted
on
the
inhabitants
as
is
usual
in
towns
but
lived
in
it
as
in
a
camp.
Though
tattered,
hungry,
worn
out,
and
reduced
to
a
third
of
their
original
number,
the
French
entered
Moscow
in
good
marching
order.
It
was
a
weary
and
famished,
but
still
a
fighting
and
menacing
army.
But
it
remained
an
army
only
until
its
soldiers
had
dispersed
into
their
different
lodgings.
As
soon
as
the
men
of
the
various
regiments
began
to
disperse
among
the
wealthy
and
deserted
houses,
the
army
was
lost
forever
and
there
came
into
being
something
nondescript,
neither
citizens
nor
soldiers
but
what
are
known
as
marauders.
When
five
weeks
later
these
same
men
left
Moscow,
they
no
longer
formed
an
army.
They
were
a
mob
of
marauders,
each
carrying
a
quantity
of
articles
which
seemed
to
him
valuable
or
useful.
The
aim
of
each
man
when
he
left
Moscow
was
no
longer,
as
it
had
been,
to
conquer,
but
merely
to
keep
what
he
had
acquired.
Like
a
monkey
which
puts
its
paw
into
the
narrow
neck
of
a
jug,
and
having
seized
a
handful
of
nuts
will
not
open
its
fist
for
fear
of
losing
what
it
holds,
and
therefore
perishes,
the
French
when
they
left
Moscow
had
inevitably
to
perish
because
they
carried
their
loot
with
them,
yet
to
abandon
what
they
had
stolen
was
as
impossible
for
them
as
it
is
for
the
monkey
to
open
its
paw
and
let
go
of
its
nuts.
Ten
minutes
after
each
regiment
had
entered
a
Moscow
district,
not
a
soldier
or
officer
was
left.
Men
in
military
uniforms
and
Hessian
boots
could
be
seen
through
the
windows,
laughing
and
walking
through
the
rooms.
In
cellars
and
storerooms
similar
men
were
busy
among
the
provisions,
and
in
the
yards
unlocking
or
breaking
open
coach
house
and
stable
doors,
lighting
fires
in
kitchens
and
kneading
and
baking
bread
with
rolled-up
sleeves,
and
cooking;
or
frightening,
amusing,
or
caressing
women
and
children.
There
were
many
such
men
both
in
the
shops
and
houses--but
there
was
no
army.
Order
after
order
was
issued
by
the
French
commanders
that
day
forbidding
the
men
to
disperse
about
the
town,
sternly
forbidding
any
violence
to
the
inhabitants
or
any
looting,
and
announcing
a
roll
call
for
that
very
evening.
But
despite
all
these
measures
the
men,
who
had
till
then
constituted
an
army,
flowed
all
over
the
wealthy,
deserted
city
with
its
comforts
and
plentiful
supplies.
As
a
hungry
herd
of
cattle
keeps
well
together
when
crossing
a
barren
field,
but
gets
out
of
hand
and
at
once
disperses
uncontrollably
as
soon
as
it
reaches
rich
pastures,
so
did
the
army
disperse
all
over
the
wealthy
city.
No
residents
were
left
in
Moscow,
and
the
soldiers--like
water
percolating
through
sand--spread
irresistibly
through
the
city
in
all
directions
from
the
Kremlin
into
which
they
had
first
marched.
The
cavalry,
on
entering
a
merchant's
house
that
had
been
abandoned
and
finding
there
stabling
more
than
sufficient
for
their
horses,
went
on,
all
the
same,
to
the
next
house
which
seemed
to
them
better.
Many
of
them
appropriated
several
houses,
chalked
their
names
on
them,
and
quarreled
and
even
fought
with
other
companies
for
them.
Before
they
had
had
time
to
secure
quarters
the
soldiers
ran
out
into
the
streets
to
see
the
city
and,
hearing
that
everything
had
been
abandoned,
rushed
to
places
where
valuables
were
to
be
had
for
the
taking.
The
officers
followed
to
check
the
soldiers
and
were
involuntarily
drawn
into
doing
the
same.
In
Carriage
Row
carriages
had
been
left
in
the
shops,
and
generals
flocked
there
to
select
caleches
and
coaches
for
themselves.
The
few
inhabitants
who
had
remained
invited
commanding
officers
to
their
houses,
hoping
thereby
to
secure
themselves
from
being
plundered.
There
were
masses
of
wealth
and
there
seemed
no
end
to
it.
All
around
the
quarters
occupied
by
the
French
were
other
regions
still
unexplored
and
unoccupied
where,
they
thought,
yet
greater
riches
might
be
found.
And
Moscow
engulfed
the
army
ever
deeper
and
deeper.
When
water
is
spilled
on
dry
ground
both
the
dry
ground
and
the
water
disappear
and
mud
results;
and
in
the
same
way
the
entry
of
the
famished
army
into
the
rich
and
deserted
city
resulted
in
fires
and
looting
and
the
destruction
of
both
the
army
and
the
wealthy
city.
The
French
attributed
the
Fire
of
Moscow
au
patriotisme
feroce
de
Rostopchine,
*
the
Russians
to
the
barbarity
of
the
French.
In
reality,
however,
it
was
not,
and
could
not
be,
possible
to
explain
the
burning
of
Moscow
by
making
any
individual,
or
any
group
of
people,
responsible
for
it.
Moscow
was
burned
because
it
found
itself
in
a
position
in
which
any
town
built
of
wood
was
bound
to
burn,
quite
apart
from
whether
it
had,
or
had
not,
a
hundred
and
thirty
inferior
fire
engines.
Deserted
Moscow
had
to
burn
as
inevitably
as
a
heap
of
shavings
has
to
burn
on
which
sparks
continually
fall
for
several
days.
A
town
built
of
wood,
where
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
conflagrations
when
the
house
owners
are
in
residence
and
a
police
force
is
present,
cannot
help
burning
when
its
inhabitants
have
left
it
and
it
is
occupied
by
soldiers
who
smoke
pipes,
make
campfires
of
the
Senate
chairs
in
the
Senate
Square,
and
cook
themselves
meals
twice
a
day.
In
peacetime
it
is
only
necessary
to
billet
troops
in
the
villages
of
any
district
and
the
number
of
fires
in
that
district
immediately
increases.
How
much
then
must
the
probability
of
fire
be
increased
in
an
abandoned,
wooden
town
where
foreign
troops
are
quartered.
"Le
patriotisme
feroce
de
Rostopchine"
and
the
barbarity
of
the
French
were
not
to
blame
in
the
matter.
Moscow
was
set
on
fire
by
the
soldiers'
pipes,
kitchens,
and
campfires,
and
by
the
carelessness
of
enemy
soldiers
occupying
houses
they
did
not
own.
Even
if
there
was
any
arson
(which
is
very
doubtful,
for
no
one
had
any
reason
to
burn
the
houses--in
any
case
a
troublesome
and
dangerous
thing
to
do),
arson
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
cause,
for
the
same
thing
would
have
happened
without
any
incendiarism.
*
To
Rostopchin's
ferocious
patriotism.
However
tempting
it
might
be
for
the
French
to
blame
Rostopchin's
ferocity
and
for
Russians
to
blame
the
scoundrel
Bonaparte,
or
later
on
to
place
an
heroic
torch
in
the
hands
of
their
own
people,
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
that
there
could
be
no
such
direct
cause
of
the
fire,
for
Moscow
had
to
burn
as
every
village,
factory,
or
house
must
burn
which
is
left
by
its
owners
and
in
which
strangers
are
allowed
to
live
and
cook
their
porridge.
Moscow
was
burned
by
its
inhabitants,
it
is
true,
but
by
those
who
had
abandoned
it
and
not
by
those
who
remained
in
it.
Moscow
when
occupied
by
the
enemy
did
not
remain
intact
like
Berlin,
Vienna,
and
other
towns,
simply
because
its
inhabitants
abandoned
it
and
did
not
welcome
the
French
with
bread
and
salt,
nor
bring
them
the
keys
of
the
city.
CHAPTER
XXVII
The
absorption
of
the
French
by
Moscow,
radiating
starwise
as
it
did,
only
reached
the
quarter
where
Pierre
was
staying
by
the
evening
of
the
second
of
September.
After
the
last
two
days
spent
in
solitude
and
unusual
circumstances,
Pierre
was
in
a
state
bordering
on
insanity.
He
was
completely
obsessed
by
one
persistent
thought.
He
did
not
know
how
or
when
this
thought
had
taken
such
possession
of
him,
but
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
past,
understood
nothing
of
the
present,
and
all
he
saw
and
heard
appeared
to
him
like
a
dream.
He
had
left
home
only
to
escape
the
intricate
tangle
of
life's
demands
that
enmeshed
him,
and
which
in
his
present
condition
he
was
unable
to
unravel.
He
had
gone
to
Joseph
Alexeevich's
house,
on
the
plea
of
sorting
the
deceased's
books
and
papers,
only
in
search
of
rest
from
life's
turmoil,
for
in
his
mind
the
memory
of
Joseph
Alexeevich
was
connected
with
a
world
of
eternal,
solemn,
and
calm
thoughts,
quite
contrary
to
the
restless
confusion
into
which
he
felt
himself
being
drawn.
He
sought
a
quiet
refuge,
and
in
Joseph
Alexeevich's
study
he
really
found
it.
When
he
sat
with
his
elbows
on
the
dusty
writing
table
in
the
deathlike
stillness
of
the
study,
calm
and
significant
memories
of
the
last
few
days
rose
one
after
another
in
his
imagination,
particularly
of
the
battle
of
Borodino
and
of
that
vague
sense
of
his
own
insignificance
and
insincerity
compared
with
the
truth,
simplicity,
and
strength
of
the
class
of
men
he
mentally
classed
as
they.
When
Gerasim
roused
him
from
his
reverie
the
idea
occurred
to
him
of
taking
part
in
the
popular
defense
of
Moscow
which
he
knew
was
projected.
And
with
that
object
he
had
asked
Gerasim
to
get
him
a
peasant's
coat
and
a
pistol,
confiding
to
him
his
intentions
of
remaining
in
Joseph
Alexeevich's
house
and
keeping
his
name
secret.
Then
during
the
first
day
spent
in
inaction
and
solitude
(he
tried
several
times
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
masonic
manuscripts,
but
was
unable
to
do
so)
the
idea
that
had
previously
occurred
to
him
of
the
cabalistic
significance
of
his
name
in
connection
with
Bonaparte's
more
than
once
vaguely
presented
itself.
But
the
idea
that
he,
L'russe
Besuhof,
was
destined
to
set
a
limit
to
the
power
of
the
Beast
was
as
yet
only
one
of
the
fancies
that
often
passed
through
his
mind
and
left
no
trace
behind.
When,
having
bought
the
coat
merely
with
the
object
of
taking
part
among
the
people
in
the
defense
of
Moscow,
Pierre
had
met
the
Rostovs
and
Natasha
had
said
to
him:
"Are
you
remaining
in
Moscow?...
How
splendid!"
the
thought
flashed
into
his
mind
that
it
really
would
be
a
good
thing,
even
if
Moscow
were
taken,
for
him
to
remain
there
and
do
what
he
was
predestined
to
do.
Next
day,
with
the
sole
idea
of
not
sparing
himself
and
not
lagging
in
any
way
behind
them,
Pierre
went
to
the
Three
Hills
gate.
But
when
he
returned
to
the
house
convinced
that
Moscow
would
not
be
defended,
he
suddenly
felt
that
what
before
had
seemed
to
him
merely
a
possibility
had
now
become
absolutely
necessary
and
inevitable.
He
must
remain
in
Moscow,
concealing
his
name,
and
must
meet
Napoleon
and
kill
him,
and
either
perish
or
put
an
end
to
the
misery
of
all
Europe--which
it
seemed
to
him
was
solely
due
to
Napoleon.
Pierre
knew
all
the
details
of
the
attempt
on
Bonaparte's
life
in
1809
by
a
German
student
in
Vienna,
and
knew
that
the
student
had
been
shot.
And
the
risk
to
which
he
would
expose
his
life
by
carrying
out
his
design
excited
him
still
more.
Two
equally
strong
feelings
drew
Pierre
irresistibly
to
this
purpose.
The
first
was
a
feeling
of
the
necessity
of
sacrifice
and
suffering
in
view
of
the
common
calamity,
the
same
feeling
that
had
caused
him
to
go
to
Mozhaysk
on
the
twenty-fifth
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
very
thick
of
the
battle
and
had
now
caused
him
to
run
away
from
his
home
and,
in
place
of
the
luxury
and
comfort
to
which
he
was
accustomed,
to
sleep
on
a
hard
sofa
without
undressing
and
eat
the
same
food
as
Gerasim.
The
other
was
that
vague
and
quite
Russian
feeling
of
contempt
for
everything
conventional,
artificial,
and
human--for
everything
the
majority
of
men
regard
as
the
greatest
good
in
the
world.
Pierre
had
first
experienced
this
strange
and
fascinating
feeling
at
the
Sloboda
Palace,
when
he
had
suddenly
felt
that
wealth,
power,
and
life--all
that
men
so
painstakingly
acquire
and
guard--if
it
has
any
worth
has
so
only
by
reason
of
the
joy
with
which
it
can
all
be
renounced.
It
was
the
feeling
that
induces
a
volunteer
recruit
to
spend
his
last
penny
on
drink,
and
a
drunken
man
to
smash
mirrors
or
glasses
for
no
apparent
reason
and
knowing
that
it
will
cost
him
all
the
money
he
possesses:
the
feeling
which
causes
a
man
to
perform
actions
which
from
an
ordinary
point
of
view
are
insane,
to
test,
as
it
were,
his
personal
power
and
strength,
affirming
the
existence
of
a
higher,
nonhuman
criterion
of
life.
From
the
very
day
Pierre
had
experienced
this
feeling
for
the
first
time
at
the
Sloboda
Palace
he
had
been
continuously
under
its
influence,
but
only
now
found
full
satisfaction
for
it.
Moreover,
at
this
moment
Pierre
was
supported
in
his
design
and
prevented
from
renouncing
it
by
what
he
had
already
done
in
that
direction.
If
he
were
now
to
leave
Moscow
like
everyone
else,
his
flight
from
home,
the
peasant
coat,
the
pistol,
and
his
announcement
to
the
Rostovs
that
he
would
remain
in
Moscow
would
all
become
not
merely
meaningless
but
contemptible
and
ridiculous,
and
to
this
Pierre
was
very
sensitive.
Pierre's
physical
condition,
as
is
always
the
case,
corresponded
to
his
mental
state.
The
unaccustomed
coarse
food,
the
vodka
he
drank
during
those
days,
the
absence
of
wine
and
cigars,
his
dirty
unchanged
linen,
two
almost
sleepless
nights
passed
on
a
short
sofa
without
bedding--all
this
kept
him
in
a
state
of
excitement
bordering
on
insanity.
It
was
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
The
French
had
already
entered
Moscow.
Pierre
knew
this,
but
instead
of
acting
he
only
thought
about
his
undertaking,
going
over
its
minutest
details
in
his
mind.
In
his
fancy
he
did
not
clearly
picture
to
himself
either
the
striking
of
the
blow
or
the
death
of
Napoleon,
but
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
melancholy
enjoyment
imagined
his
own
destruction
and
heroic
endurance.
"Yes,
alone,
for
the
sake
of
all,
I
must
do
it
or
perish!"
he
thought.
"Yes,
I
will
approach...
and
then
suddenly...
with
pistol
or
dagger?
But
that
is
all
the
same!
'It
is
not
I
but
the
hand
of
Providence
that
punishes
thee,'
I
shall
say,"
thought
he,
imagining
what
he
would
say
when
killing
Napoleon.
"Well
then,
take
me
and
execute
me!"
he
went
on,
speaking
to
himself
and
bowing
his
head
with
a
sad
but
firm
expression.
While
Pierre,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room,
was
talking
to
himself
in
this
way,
the
study
door
opened
and
on
the
threshold
appeared
the
figure
of
Makar
Alexeevich,
always
so
timid
before
but
now
quite
transformed.
His
dressing
gown
was
unfastened,
his
face
red
and
distorted.
He
was
obviously
drunk.
On
seeing
Pierre
he
grew
confused
at
first,
but
noticing
embarrassment
on
Pierre's
face
immediately
grew
bold
and,
staggering
on
his
thin
legs,
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room.
"They're
frightened,"
he
said
confidentially
in
a
hoarse
voice.
"I
say
I
won't
surrender,
I
say...
Am
I
not
right,
sir?"
He
paused
and
then
suddenly
seeing
the
pistol
on
the
table
seized
it
with
unexpected
rapidity
and
ran
out
into
the
corridor.
Gerasim
and
the
porter,
who
had
followed
Makar
Alexeevich,
stopped
him
in
the
vestibule
and
tried
to
take
the
pistol
from
him.
Pierre,
coming
out
into
the
corridor,
looked
with
pity
and
repulsion
at
the
half-crazy
old
man.
Makar
Alexeevich,
frowning
with
exertion,
held
on
to
the
pistol
and
screamed
hoarsely,
evidently
with
some
heroic
fancy
in
his
head.
"To
arms!
Board
them!
No,
you
shan't
get
it,"
he
yelled.
"That
will
do,
please,
that
will
do.
Have
the
goodness--please,
sir,
to
let
go!
Please,
sir..."
pleaded
Gerasim,
trying
carefully
to
steer
Makar
Alexeevich
by
the
elbows
back
to
the
door.
"Who
are
you?
Bonaparte!..."
shouted
Makar
Alexeevich.
"That's
not
right,
sir.
Come
to
your
room,
please,
and
rest.
Allow
me
to
have
the
pistol."
"Be
off,
thou
base
slave!
Touch
me
not!
See
this?"
shouted
Makar
Alexeevich,
brandishing
the
pistol.
"Board
them!"
"Catch
hold!"
whispered
Gerasim
to
the
porter.
They
seized
Makar
Alexeevich
by
the
arms
and
dragged
him
to
the
door.
The
vestibule
was
filled
with
the
discordant
sounds
of
a
struggle
and
of
a
tipsy,
hoarse
voice.
Suddenly
a
fresh
sound,
a
piercing
feminine
scream,
reverberated
from
the
porch
and
the
cook
came
running
into
the
vestibule.
"It's
them!
Gracious
heavens!
O
Lord,
four
of
them,
horsemen!"
she
cried.
Gerasim
and
the
porter
let
Makar
Alexeevich
go,
and
in
the
now
silent
corridor
the
sound
of
several
hands
knocking
at
the
front
door
could
be
heard.
CHAPTER
XXVIII
Pierre,
having
decided
that
until
he
had
carried
out
his
design
he
would
disclose
neither
his
identity
nor
his
knowledge
of
French,
stood
at
the
half-open
door
of
the
corridor,
intending
to
conceal
himself
as
soon
as
the
French
entered.
But
the
French
entered
and
still
Pierre
did
not
retire--an
irresistible
curiosity
kept
him
there.
There
were
two
of
them.
One
was
an
officer--a
tall,
soldierly,
handsome
man--the
other
evidently
a
private
or
an
orderly,
sunburned,
short,
and
thin,
with
sunken
cheeks
and
a
dull
expression.
The
officer
walked
in
front,
leaning
on
a
stick
and
slightly
limping.
When
he
had
advanced
a
few
steps
he
stopped,
having
apparently
decided
that
these
were
good
quarters,
turned
round
to
the
soldiers
standing
at
the
entrance,
and
in
a
loud
voice
of
command
ordered
them
to
put
up
the
horses.
Having
done
that,
the
officer,
lifting
his
elbow
with
a
smart
gesture,
stroked
his
mustache
and
lightly
touched
his
hat.
"Bonjour,
la
compagnie!"
*
said
he
gaily,
smiling
and
looking
about
him.
*
"Good
day,
everybody!"
No
one
gave
any
reply.
"Vous
etes
le
bourgeois?"
*
the
officer
asked
Gerasim.
*
"Are
you
the
master
here?"
Gerasim
gazed
at
the
officer
with
an
alarmed
and
inquiring
look.
"Quartier,
quartier,
logement!"
said
the
officer,
looking
down
at
the
little
man
with
a
condescending
and
good-natured
smile.
"Les
francais
sont
de
bons
enfants.
Que
diable!
Voyons!
Ne
nous
fachons
pas,
mon
vieux!"
*
added
he,
clapping
the
scared
and
silent
Gerasim
on
the
shoulder.
"Well,
does
no
one
speak
French
in
this
establishment?"
he
asked
again
in
French,
looking
around
and
meeting
Pierre's
eyes.
Pierre
moved
away
from
the
door.
*
"Quarters,
quarters,
lodgings!
The
French
are
good
fellows.
What
the
devil!
There,
don't
let
us
be
cross,
old
fellow!"
Again
the
officer
turned
to
Gerasim
and
asked
him
to
show
him
the
rooms
in
the
house.
"Master,
not
here--don't
understand...
me,
you..."
said
Gerasim,
trying
to
render
his
words
more
comprehensible
by
contorting
them.
Still
smiling,
the
French
officer
spread
out
his
hands
before
Gerasim's
nose,
intimating
that
he
did
not
understand
him
either,
and
moved,
limping,
to
the
door
at
which
Pierre
was
standing.
Pierre
wished
to
go
away
and
conceal
himself,
but
at
that
moment
he
saw
Makar
Alexeevich
appearing
at
the
open
kitchen
door
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand.
With
a
madman's
cunning,
Makar
Alexeevich
eyed
the
Frenchman,
raised
his
pistol,
and
took
aim.
"Board
them!"
yelled
the
tipsy
man,
trying
to
press
the
trigger.
Hearing
the
yell
the
officer
turned
round,
and
at
the
same
moment
Pierre
threw
himself
on
the
drunkard.
Just
when
Pierre
snatched
at
and
struck
up
the
pistol
Makar
Alexeevich
at
last
got
his
fingers
on
the
trigger,
there
was
a
deafening
report,
and
all
were
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke.
The
Frenchman
turned
pale
and
rushed
to
the
door.
Forgetting
his
intention
of
concealing
his
knowledge
of
French,
Pierre,
snatching
away
the
pistol
and
throwing
it
down,
ran
up
to
the
officer
and
addressed
him
in
French.
"You
are
not
wounded?"
he
asked.
"I
think
not,"
answered
the
Frenchman,
feeling
himself
over.
"But
I
have
had
a
lucky
escape
this
time,"
he
added,
pointing
to
the
damaged
plaster
of
the
wall.
"Who
is
that
man?"
said
he,
looking
sternly
at
Pierre.
"Oh,
I
am
really
in
despair
at
what
has
occurred,"
said
Pierre
rapidly,
quite
forgetting
the
part
he
had
intended
to
play.
"He
is
an
unfortunate
madman
who
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing."
The
officer
went
up
to
Makar
Alexeevich
and
took
him
by
the
collar.
Makar
Alexeevich
was
standing
with
parted
lips,
swaying,
as
if
about
to
fall
asleep,
as
he
leaned
against
the
wall.
"Brigand!
You
shall
pay
for
this,"
said
the
Frenchman,
letting
go
of
him.
"We
French
are
merciful
after
victory,
but
we
do
not
pardon
traitors,"
he
added,
with
a
look
of
gloomy
dignity
and
a
fine
energetic
gesture.
Pierre
continued,
in
French,
to
persuade
the
officer
not
to
hold
that
drunken
imbecile
to
account.
The
Frenchman
listened
in
silence
with
the
same
gloomy
expression,
but
suddenly
turned
to
Pierre
with
a
smile.
For
a
few
seconds
he
looked
at
him
in
silence.
His
handsome
face
assumed
a
melodramatically
gentle
expression
and
he
held
out
his
hand.
"You
have
saved
my
life.
You
are
French,"
said
he.
For
a
Frenchman
that
deduction
was
indubitable.
Only
a
Frenchman
could
perform
a
great
deed,
and
to
save
his
life--the
life
of
M.
Ramballe,
captain
of
the
13th
Light
Regiment--was
undoubtedly
a
very
great
deed.
But
however
indubitable
that
conclusion
and
the
officer's
conviction
based
upon
it,
Pierre
felt
it
necessary
to
disillusion
him.
"I
am
Russian,"
he
said
quickly.
"Tut,
tut,
tut!
Tell
that
to
others,"
said
the
officer,
waving
his
finger
before
his
nose
and
smiling.
"You
shall
tell
me
all
about
that
presently.
I
am
delighted
to
meet
a
compatriot.
Well,
and
what
are
we
to
do
with
this
man?"
he
added,
addressing
himself
to
Pierre
as
to
a
brother.
Even
if
Pierre
were
not
a
Frenchman,
having
once
received
that
loftiest
of
human
appellations
he
could
not
renounce
it,
said
the
officer's
look
and
tone.
In
reply
to
his
last
question
Pierre
again
explained
who
Makar
Alexeevich
was
and
how
just
before
their
arrival
that
drunken
imbecile
had
seized
the
loaded
pistol
which
they
had
not
had
time
to
recover
from
him,
and
begged
the
officer
to
let
the
deed
go
unpunished.
The
Frenchman
expanded
his
chest
and
made
a
majestic
gesture
with
his
arm.
"You
have
saved
my
life!
You
are
French.
You
ask
his
pardon?
I
grant
it
you.
Lead
that
man
away!"
said
he
quickly
and
energetically,
and
taking
the
arm
of
Pierre
whom
he
had
promoted
to
be
a
Frenchman
for
saving
his
life,
he
went
with
him
into
the
room.
The
soldiers
in
the
yard,
hearing
the
shot,
came
into
the
passage
asking
what
had
happened,
and
expressed
their
readiness
to
punish
the
culprits,
but
the
officer
sternly
checked
them.
"You
will
be
called
in
when
you
are
wanted,"
he
said.
The
soldiers
went
out
again,
and
the
orderly,
who
had
meanwhile
had
time
to
visit
the
kitchen,
came
up
to
his
officer.
"Captain,
there
is
soup
and
a
leg
of
mutton
in
the
kitchen,"
said
he.
"Shall
I
serve
them
up?"
"Yes,
and
some
wine,"
answered
the
captain.
CHAPTER
XXIX
When
the
French
officer
went
into
the
room
with
Pierre
the
latter
again
thought
it
his
duty
to
assure
him
that
he
was
not
French
and
wished
to
go
away,
but
the
officer
would
not
hear
of
it.
He
was
so
very
polite,
amiable,
good-natured,
and
genuinely
grateful
to
Pierre
for
saving
his
life
that
Pierre
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse,
and
sat
down
with
him
in
the
parlor--the
first
room
they
entered.
To
Pierre's
assurances
that
he
was
not
a
Frenchman,
the
captain,
evidently
not
understanding
how
anyone
could
decline
so
flattering
an
appellation,
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
that
if
Pierre
absolutely
insisted
on
passing
for
a
Russian
let
it
be
so,
but
for
all
that
he
would
be
forever
bound
to
Pierre
by
gratitude
for
saving
his
life.
Had
this
man
been
endowed
with
the
slightest
capacity
for
perceiving
the
feelings
of
others,
and
had
he
at
all
understood
what
Pierre's
feelings
were,
the
latter
would
probably
have
left
him,
but
the
man's
animated
obtuseness
to
everything
other
than
himself
disarmed
Pierre.
"A
Frenchman
or
a
Russian
prince
incognito,"
said
the
officer,
looking
at
Pierre's
fine
though
dirty
linen
and
at
the
ring
on
his
finger.
"I
owe
my
life
to
you
and
offer
you
my
friendship.
A
Frenchman
never
forgets
either
an
insult
or
a
service.
I
offer
you
my
friendship.
That
is
all
I
can
say."
There
was
so
much
good
nature
and
nobility
(in
the
French
sense
of
the
word)
in
the
officer's
voice,
in
the
expression
of
his
face
and
in
his
gestures,
that
Pierre,
unconsciously
smiling
in
response
to
the
Frenchman's
smile,
pressed
the
hand
held
out
to
him.
"Captain
Ramballe,
of
the
13th
Light
Regiment,
Chevalier
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
for
the
affair
on
the
seventh
of
September,"
he
introduced
himself,
a
self-satisfied
irrepressible
smile
puckering
his
lips
under
his
mustache.
"Will
you
now
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
with
whom
I
have
the
honor
of
conversing
so
pleasantly,
instead
of
being
in
the
ambulance
with
that
maniac's
bullet
in
my
body?"
Pierre
replied
that
he
could
not
tell
him
his
name
and,
blushing,
began
to
try
to
invent
a
name
and
to
say
something
about
his
reason
for
concealing
it,
but
the
Frenchman
hastily
interrupted
him.
"Oh,
please!"
said
he.
"I
understand
your
reasons.
You
are
an
officer...
a
superior
officer
perhaps.
You
have
borne
arms
against
us.
That's
not
my
business.
I
owe
you
my
life.
That
is
enough
for
me.
I
am
quite
at
your
service.
You
belong
to
the
gentry?"
he
concluded
with
a
shade
of
inquiry
in
his
tone.
Pierre
bent
his
head.
"Your
baptismal
name,
if
you
please.
That
is
all
I
ask.
Monsieur
Pierre,
you
say....
That's
all
I
want
to
know."
When
the
mutton
and
an
omelet
had
been
served
and
a
samovar
and
vodka
brought,
with
some
wine
which
the
French
had
taken
from
a
Russian
cellar
and
brought
with
them,
Ramballe
invited
Pierre
to
share
his
dinner,
and
himself
began
to
eat
greedily
and
quickly
like
a
healthy
and
hungry
man,
munching
his
food
rapidly
with
his
strong
teeth,
continually
smacking
his
lips,
and
repeating--"Excellent!
Delicious!"
His
face
grew
red
and
was
covered
with
perspiration.
Pierre
was
hungry
and
shared
the
dinner
with
pleasure.
Morel,
the
orderly,
brought
some
hot
water
in
a
saucepan
and
placed
a
bottle
of
claret
in
it.
He
also
brought
a
bottle
of
kvass,
taken
from
the
kitchen
for
them
to
try.
That
beverage
was
already
known
to
the
French
and
had
been
given
a
special
name.
They
called
it
limonade
de
cochon
(pig's
lemonade),
and
Morel
spoke
well
of
the
limonade
de
cochon
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen.
But
as
the
captain
had
the
wine
they
had
taken
while
passing
through
Moscow,
he
left
the
kvass
to
Morel
and
applied
himself
to
the
bottle
of
Bordeaux.
He
wrapped
the
bottle
up
to
its
neck
in
a
table
napkin
and
poured
out
wine
for
himself
and
for
Pierre.
The
satisfaction
of
his
hunger
and
the
wine
rendered
the
captain
still
more
lively
and
he
chatted
incessantly
all
through
dinner.
"Yes,
my
dear
Monsieur
Pierre,
I
owe
you
a
fine
votive
candle
for
saving
me
from
that
maniac....
You
see,
I
have
bullets
enough
in
my
body
already.
Here
is
one
I
got
at
Wagram"
(he
touched
his
side)
"and
a
second
at
Smolensk"--he
showed
a
scar
on
his
cheek--"and
this
leg
which
as
you
see
does
not
want
to
march,
I
got
that
on
the
seventh
at
the
great
battle
of
la
Moskowa.
Sacre
Dieu!
It
was
splendid!
That
deluge
of
fire
was
worth
seeing.
It
was
a
tough
job
you
set
us
there,
my
word!
You
may
be
proud
of
it!
And
on
my
honor,
in
spite
of
the
cough
I
caught
there,
I
should
be
ready
to
begin
again.
I
pity
those
who
did
not
see
it."
"I
was
there,"
said
Pierre.
"Bah,
really?
So
much
the
better!
You
are
certainly
brave
foes.
The
great
redoubt
held
out
well,
by
my
pipe!"
continued
the
Frenchman.
"And
you
made
us
pay
dear
for
it.
I
was
at
it
three
times--sure
as
I
sit
here.
Three
times
we
reached
the
guns
and
three
times
we
were
thrown
back
like
cardboard
figures.
Oh,
it
was
beautiful,
Monsieur
Pierre!
Your
grenadiers
were
splendid,
by
heaven!
I
saw
them
close
up
their
ranks
six
times
in
succession
and
march
as
if
on
parade.
Fine
fellows!
Our
King
of
Naples,
who
knows
what's
what,
cried
'Bravo!'
Ha,
ha!
So
you
are
one
of
us
soldiers!"
he
added,
smiling,
after
a
momentary
pause.
"So
much
the
better,
so
much
the
better,
Monsieur
Pierre!
Terrible
in
battle...
gallant...
with
the
fair"
(he
winked
and
smiled),
"that's
what
the
French
are,
Monsieur
Pierre,
aren't
they?"
The
captain
was
so
naively
and
good-humoredly
gay,
so
real,
and
so
pleased
with
himself
that
Pierre
almost
winked
back
as
he
looked
merrily
at
him.
Probably
the
word
"gallant"
turned
the
captain's
thoughts
to
the
state
of
Moscow.
"Apropos,
tell
me
please,
is
it
true
that
the
women
have
all
left
Moscow?
What
a
queer
idea!
What
had
they
to
be
afraid
of?"
"Would
not
the
French
ladies
leave
Paris
if
the
Russians
entered
it?"
asked
Pierre.
"Ha,
ha,
ha!"
The
Frenchman
emitted
a
merry,
sanguine
chuckle,
patting
Pierre
on
the
shoulder.
"What
a
thing
to
say!"
he
exclaimed.
"Paris?...
But
Paris,
Paris..."
"Paris--the
capital
of
the
world,"
Pierre
finished
his
remark
for
him.
The
captain
looked
at
Pierre.
He
had
a
habit
of
stopping
short
in
the
middle
of
his
talk
and
gazing
intently
with
his
laughing,
kindly
eyes.
"Well,
if
you
hadn't
told
me
you
were
Russian,
I
should
have
wagered
that
you
were
Parisian!
You
have
that...
I
don't
know
what,
that..."
and
having
uttered
this
compliment,
he
again
gazed
at
him
in
silence.
"I
have
been
in
Paris.
I
spent
years
there,"
said
Pierre.
"Oh
yes,
one
sees
that
plainly.
Paris!...
A
man
who
doesn't
know
Paris
is
a
savage.
You
can
tell
a
Parisian
two
leagues
off.
Paris
is
Talma,
la
Duchenois,
Potier,
the
Sorbonne,
the
boulevards,"
and
noticing
that
his
conclusion
was
weaker
than
what
had
gone
before,
he
added
quickly:
"There
is
only
one
Paris
in
the
world.
You
have
been
to
Paris
and
have
remained
Russian.
Well,
I
don't
esteem
you
the
less
for
it."
Under
the
influence
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk,
and
after
the
days
he
had
spent
alone
with
his
depressing
thoughts,
Pierre
involuntarily
enjoyed
talking
with
this
cheerful
and
good-natured
man.
"To
return
to
your
ladies--I
hear
they
are
lovely.
What
a
wretched
idea
to
go
and
bury
themselves
in
the
steppes
when
the
French
army
is
in
Moscow.
What
a
chance
those
girls
have
missed!
Your
peasants,
now--
that's
another
thing;
but
you
civilized
people,
you
ought
to
know
us
better
than
that.
We
took
Vienna,
Berlin,
Madrid,
Naples,
Rome,
Warsaw,
all
the
world's
capitals....
We
are
feared,
but
we
are
loved.
We
are
nice
to
know.
And
then
the
Emperor..."
he
began,
but
Pierre
interrupted
him.
"The
Emperor,"
Pierre
repeated,
and
his
face
suddenly
became
sad
and
embarrassed,
"is
the
Emperor...?"
"The
Emperor?
He
is
generosity,
mercy,
justice,
order,
genius--that's
what
the
Emperor
is!
It
is
I,
Ramballe,
who
tell
you
so....
I
assure
you
I
was
his
enemy
eight
years
ago.
My
father
was
an
emigrant
count....
But
that
man
has
vanquished
me.
He
has
taken
hold
of
me.
I
could
not
resist
the
sight
of
the
grandeur
and
glory
with
which
he
has
covered
France.
When
I
understood
what
he
wanted--when
I
saw
that
he
was
preparing
a
bed
of
laurels
for
us,
you
know,
I
said
to
myself:
'That
is
a
monarch,'
and
I
devoted
myself
to
him!
So
there!
Oh
yes,
mon
cher,
he
is
the
greatest
man
of
the
ages
past
or
future."
"Is
he
in
Moscow?"
Pierre
stammered
with
a
guilty
look.
The
Frenchman
looked
at
his
guilty
face
and
smiled.
"No,
he
will
make
his
entry
tomorrow,"
he
replied,
and
continued
his
talk.
Their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
cries
of
several
voices
at
the
gate
and
by
Morel,
who
came
to
say
that
some
Wurttemberg
hussars
had
come
and
wanted
to
put
up
their
horses
in
the
yard
where
the
captain's
horses
were.
This
difficulty
had
arisen
chiefly
because
the
hussars
did
not
understand
what
was
said
to
them
in
French.
The
captain
had
their
senior
sergeant
called
in,
and
in
a
stern
voice
asked
him
to
what
regiment
he
belonged,
who
was
his
commanding
officer,
and
by
what
right
he
allowed
himself
to
claim
quarters
that
were
already
occupied.
The
German
who
knew
little
French,
answered
the
two
first
questions
by
giving
the
names
of
his
regiment
and
of
his
commanding
officer,
but
in
reply
to
the
third
question
which
he
did
not
understand
said,
introducing
broken
French
into
his
own
German,
that
he
was
the
quartermaster
of
the
regiment
and
his
commander
had
ordered
him
to
occupy
all
the
houses
one
after
another.
Pierre,
who
knew
German,
translated
what
the
German
said
to
the
captain
and
gave
the
captain's
reply
to
the
Wurttemberg
hussar
in
German.
When
he
had
understood
what
was
said
to
him,
the
German
submitted
and
took
his
men
elsewhere.
The
captain
went
out
into
the
porch
and
gave
some
orders
in
a
loud
voice.
When
he
returned
to
the
room
Pierre
was
sitting
in
the
same
place
as
before,
with
his
head
in
his
hands.
His
face
expressed
suffering.
He
really
was
suffering
at
that
moment.
When
the
captain
went
out
and
he
was
left
alone,
suddenly
he
came
to
himself
and
realized
the
position
he
was
in.
It
was
not
that
Moscow
had
been
taken
or
that
the
happy
conquerors
were
masters
in
it
and
were
patronizing
him.
Painful
as
that
was
it
was
not
that
which
tormented
Pierre
at
the
moment.
He
was
tormented
by
the
consciousness
of
his
own
weakness.
The
few
glasses
of
wine
he
had
drunk
and
the
conversation
with
this
good-natured
man
had
destroyed
the
mood
of
concentrated
gloom
in
which
he
had
spent
the
last
few
days
and
which
was
essential
for
the
execution
of
his
design.
The
pistol,
dagger,
and
peasant
coat
were
ready.
Napoleon
was
to
enter
the
town
next
day.
Pierre
still
considered
that
it
would
be
a
useful
and
worthy
action
to
slay
the
evildoer,
but
now
he
felt
that
he
would
not
do
it.
He
did
not
know
why,
but
he
felt
a
foreboding
that
he
would
not
carry
out
his
intention.
He
struggled
against
the
confession
of
his
weakness
but
dimly
felt
that
he
could
not
overcome
it
and
that
his
former
gloomy
frame
of
mind,
concerning
vengeance,
killing,
and
self-
sacrifice,
had
been
dispersed
like
dust
by
contact
with
the
first
man
he
met.
The
captain
returned
to
the
room,
limping
slightly
and
whistling
a
tune.
The
Frenchman's
chatter
which
had
previously
amused
Pierre
now
repelled
him.
The
tune
he
was
whistling,
his
gait,
and
the
gesture
with
which
he
twirled
his
mustache,
all
now
seemed
offensive.
"I
will
go
away
immediately.
I
won't
say
another
word
to
him,"
thought
Pierre.
He
thought
this,
but
still
sat
in
the
same
place.
A
strange
feeling
of
weakness
tied
him
to
the
spot;
he
wished
to
get
up
and
go
away,
but
could
not
do
so.
The
captain,
on
the
other
hand,
seemed
very
cheerful.
He
paced
up
and
down
the
room
twice.
His
eyes
shone
and
his
mustache
twitched
as
if
he
were
smiling
to
himself
at
some
amusing
thought.
"The
colonel
of
those
Wurttembergers
is
delightful,"
he
suddenly
said.
"He's
a
German,
but
a
nice
fellow
all
the
same....
But
he's
a
German."
He
sat
down
facing
Pierre.
"By
the
way,
you
know
German,
then?"
Pierre
looked
at
him
in
silence.
"What
is
the
German
for
'shelter'?"
"Shelter?"
Pierre
repeated.
"The
German
for
shelter
is
Unterkunft."
"How
do
you
say
it?"
the
captain
asked
quickly
and
doubtfully.
"Unterkunft,"
Pierre
repeated.
"Onterkoff,"
said
the
captain
and
looked
at
Pierre
for
some
seconds
with
laughing
eyes.
"These
Germans
are
first-rate
fools,
don't
you
think
so,
Monsieur
Pierre?"
he
concluded.
"Well,
let's
have
another
bottle
of
this
Moscow
Bordeaux,
shall
we?
Morel
will
warm
us
up
another
little
bottle.
Morel!"
he
called
out
gaily.
Morel
brought
candles
and
a
bottle
of
wine.
The
captain
looked
at
Pierre
by
the
candlelight
and
was
evidently
struck
by
the
troubled
expression
on
his
companion's
face.
Ramballe,
with
genuine
distress
and
sympathy
in
his
face,
went
up
to
Pierre
and
bent
over
him.
"There
now,
we're
sad,"
said
he,
touching
Pierre's
hand.
"Have
I
upset
you?
No,
really,
have
you
anything
against
me?"
he
asked
Pierre.
"Perhaps
it's
the
state
of
affairs?"
Pierre
did
not
answer,
but
looked
cordially
into
the
Frenchman's
eyes
whose
expression
of
sympathy
was
pleasing
to
him.
"Honestly,
without
speaking
of
what
I
owe
you,
I
feel
friendship
for
you.
Can
I
do
anything
for
you?
Dispose
of
me.
It
is
for
life
and
death.
I
say
it
with
my
hand
on
my
heart!"
said
he,
striking
his
chest.
"Thank
you,"
said
Pierre.
The
captain
gazed
intently
at
him
as
he
had
done
when
he
learned
that
"shelter"
was
Unterkunft
in
German,
and
his
face
suddenly
brightened.
"Well,
in
that
case,
I
drink
to
our
friendship!"
he
cried
gaily,
filling
two
glasses
with
wine.
Pierre
took
one
of
the
glasses
and
emptied
it.
Ramballe
emptied
his
too,
again
pressed
Pierre's
hand,
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
in
a
pensive
attitude.
"Yes,
my
dear
friend,"
he
began,
"such
is
fortune's
caprice.
Who
would
have
said
that
I
should
be
a
soldier
and
a
captain
of
dragoons
in
the
service
of
Bonaparte,
as
we
used
to
call
him?
Yet
here
I
am
in
Moscow
with
him.
I
must
tell
you,
mon
cher,"
he
continued
in
the
sad
and
measured
tones
of
a
man
who
intends
to
tell
a
long
story,
"that
our
name
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
in
France."
And
with
a
Frenchman's
easy
and
naive
frankness
the
captain
told
Pierre
the
story
of
his
ancestors,
his
childhood,
youth,
and
manhood,
and
all
about
his
relations
and
his
financial
and
family
affairs,
"ma
pauvre
mere"
playing
of
course
an
important
part
in
the
story.
"But
all
that
is
only
life's
setting,
the
real
thing
is
love--love!
Am
I
not
right,
Monsieur
Pierre?"
said
he,
growing
animated.
"Another
glass?"
Pierre
again
emptied
his
glass
and
poured
himself
out
a
third.
"Oh,
women,
women!"
and
the
captain,
looking
with
glistening
eyes
at
Pierre,
began
talking
of
love
and
of
his
love
affairs.
There
were
very
many
of
these,
as
one
could
easily
believe,
looking
at
the
officer's
handsome,
self-satisfied
face,
and
noting
the
eager
enthusiasm
with
which
he
spoke
of
women.
Though
all
Ramballe's
love
stories
had
the
sensual
character
which
Frenchmen
regard
as
the
special
charm
and
poetry
of
love,
yet
he
told
his
story
with
such
sincere
conviction
that
he
alone
had
experienced
and
known
all
the
charm
of
love
and
he
described
women
so
alluringly
that
Pierre
listened
to
him
with
curiosity.
It
was
plain
that
l'amour
which
the
Frenchman
was
so
fond
of
was
not
that
low
and
simple
kind
that
Pierre
had
once
felt
for
his
wife,
nor
was
it
the
romantic
love
stimulated
by
himself
that
he
experienced
for
Natasha.
(Ramballe
despised
both
these
kinds
of
love
equally:
the
one
he
considered
the
"love
of
clodhoppers"
and
the
other
the
"love
of
simpletons.")
L'amour
which
the
Frenchman
worshiped
consisted
principally
in
the
unnaturalness
of
his
relation
to
the
woman
and
in
a
combination
of
incongruities
giving
the
chief
charm
to
the
feeling.
Thus
the
captain
touchingly
recounted
the
story
of
his
love
for
a
fascinating
marquise
of
thirty-five
and
at
the
same
time
for
a
charming,
innocent
child
of
seventeen,
daughter
of
the
bewitching
marquise.
The
conflict
of
magnanimity
between
the
mother
and
the
daughter,
ending
in
the
mother's
sacrificing
herself
and
offering
her
daughter
in
marriage
to
her
lover,
even
now
agitated
the
captain,
though
it
was
the
memory
of
a
distant
past.
Then
he
recounted
an
episode
in
which
the
husband
played
the
part
of
the
lover,
and
he--the
lover--assumed
the
role
of
the
husband,
as
well
as
several
droll
incidents
from
his
recollections
of
Germany,
where
"shelter"
is
called
Unterkunft
and
where
the
husbands
eat
sauerkraut
and
the
young
girls
are
"too
blonde."
Finally,
the
latest
episode
in
Poland
still
fresh
in
the
captain's
memory,
and
which
he
narrated
with
rapid
gestures
and
glowing
face,
was
of
how
he
had
saved
the
life
of
a
Pole
(in
general,
the
saving
of
life
continually
occurred
in
the
captain's
stories)
and
the
Pole
had
entrusted
to
him
his
enchanting
wife
(parisienne
de
coeur)
while
himself
entering
the
French
service.
The
captain
was
happy,
the
enchanting
Polish
lady
wished
to
elope
with
him,
but,
prompted
by
magnanimity,
the
captain
restored
the
wife
to
the
husband,
saying
as
he
did
so:
"I
have
saved
your
life,
and
I
save
your
honor!"
Having
repeated
these
words
the
captain
wiped
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
a
shake,
as
if
driving
away
the
weakness
which
assailed
him
at
this
touching
recollection.
Listening
to
the
captain's
tales,
Pierre--as
often
happens
late
in
the
evening
and
under
the
influence
of
wine--followed
all
that
was
told
him,
understood
it
all,
and
at
the
same
time
followed
a
train
of
personal
memories
which,
he
knew
not
why,
suddenly
arose
in
his
mind.
While
listening
to
these
love
stories
his
own
love
for
Natasha
unexpectedly
rose
to
his
mind,
and
going
over
the
pictures
of
that
love
in
his
imagination
he
mentally
compared
them
with
Ramballe's
tales.
Listening
to
the
story
of
the
struggle
between
love
and
duty,
Pierre
saw
before
his
eyes
every
minutest
detail
of
his
last
meeting
with
the
object
of
his
love
at
the
Sukharev
water
tower.
At
the
time
of
that
meeting
it
had
not
produced
an
effect
upon
him--he
had
not
even
once
recalled
it.
But
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
that
meeting
had
had
in
it
something
very
important
and
poetic.
"Peter
Kirilovich,
come
here!
We
have
recognized
you,"
he
now
seemed
to
hear
the
words
she
had
uttered
and
to
see
before
him
her
eyes,
her
smile,
her
traveling
hood,
and
a
stray
lock
of
her
hair...
and
there
seemed
to
him
something
pathetic
and
touching
in
all
this.
Having
finished
his
tale
about
the
enchanting
Polish
lady,
the
captain
asked
Pierre
if
he
had
ever
experienced
a
similar
impulse
to
sacrifice
himself
for
love
and
a
feeling
of
envy
of
the
legitimate
husband.
Challenged
by
this
question
Pierre
raised
his
head
and
felt
a
need
to
express
the
thoughts
that
filled
his
mind.
He
began
to
explain
that
he
understood
love
for
a
women
somewhat
differently.
He
said
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
loved
and
still
loved
only
one
woman,
and
that
she
could
never
be
his.
"Tiens!"
said
the
captain.
Pierre
then
explained
that
he
had
loved
this
woman
from
his
earliest
years,
but
that
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
her
because
she
was
too
young,
and
because
he
had
been
an
illegitimate
son
without
a
name.
Afterwards
when
he
had
received
a
name
and
wealth
he
dared
not
think
of
her
because
he
loved
her
too
well,
placing
her
far
above
everything
in
the
world,
and
especially
therefore
above
himself.
When
he
had
reached
this
point,
Pierre
asked
the
captain
whether
he
understood
that.
The
captain
made
a
gesture
signifying
that
even
if
he
did
not
understand
it
he
begged
Pierre
to
continue.
"Platonic
love,
clouds..."
he
muttered.
Whether
it
was
the
wine
he
had
drunk,
or
an
impulse
of
frankness,
or
the
thought
that
this
man
did
not,
and
never
would,
know
any
of
those
who
played
a
part
in
his
story,
or
whether
it
was
all
these
things
together,
something
loosened
Pierre's
tongue.
Speaking
thickly
and
with
a
faraway
look
in
his
shining
eyes,
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
life:
his
marriage,
Natasha's
love
for
his
best
friend,
her
betrayal
of
him,
and
all
his
own
simple
relations
with
her.
Urged
on
by
Ramballe's
questions
he
also
told
what
he
had
at
first
concealed--his
own
position
and
even
his
name.
More
than
anything
else
in
Pierre's
story
the
captain
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
Pierre
was
very
rich,
had
two
mansions
in
Moscow,
and
that
he
had
abandoned
everything
and
not
left
the
city,
but
remained
there
concealing
his
name
and
station.
When
it
was
late
at
night
they
went
out
together
into
the
street.
The
night
was
warm
and
light.
To
the
left
of
the
house
on
the
Pokrovka
a
fire
glowed--the
first
of
those
that
were
beginning
in
Moscow.
To
the
right
and
high
up
in
the
sky
was
the
sickle
of
the
waning
moon
and
opposite
to
it
hung
that
bright
comet
which
was
connected
in
Pierre's
heart
with
his
love.
At
the
gate
stood
Gerasim,
the
cook,
and
two
Frenchmen.
Their
laughter
and
their
mutually
incomprehensible
remarks
in
two
languages
could
be
heard.
They
were
looking
at
the
glow
seen
in
the
town.
There
was
nothing
terrible
in
the
one
small,
distant
fire
in
the
immense
city.
Gazing
at
the
high
starry
sky,
at
the
moon,
at
the
comet,
and
at
the
glow
from
the
fire,
Pierre
experienced
a
joyful
emotion.
"There
now,
how
good
it
is,
what
more
does
one
need?"
thought
he.
And
suddenly
remembering
his
intention
he
grew
dizzy
and
felt
so
faint
that
he
leaned
against
the
fence
to
save
himself
from
falling.
Without
taking
leave
of
his
new
friend,
Pierre
left
the
gate
with
unsteady
steps
and
returning
to
his
room
lay
down
on
the
sofa
and
immediately
fell
asleep.
CHAPTER
XXX
The
glow
of
the
first
fire
that
began
on
the
second
of
September
was
watched
from
the
various
roads
by
the
fugitive
Muscovites
and
by
the
retreating
troops,
with
many
different
feelings.
The
Rostov
party
spent
the
night
at
Mytishchi,
fourteen
miles
from
Moscow.
They
had
started
so
late
on
the
first
of
September,
the
road
had
been
so
blocked
by
vehicles
and
troops,
so
many
things
had
been
forgotten
for
which
servants
were
sent
back,
that
they
had
decided
to
spend
that
night
at
a
place
three
miles
out
of
Moscow.
The
next
morning
they
woke
late
and
were
again
delayed
so
often
that
they
only
got
as
far
as
Great
Mytishchi.
At
ten
o'clock
that
evening
the
Rostov
family
and
the
wounded
traveling
with
them
were
all
distributed
in
the
yards
and
huts
of
that
large
village.
The
Rostovs'
servants
and
coachmen
and
the
orderlies
of
the
wounded
officers,
after
attending
to
their
masters,
had
supper,
fed
the
horses,
and
came
out
into
the
porches.
In
a
neighboring
hut
lay
Raevski's
adjutant
with
a
fractured
wrist.
The
awful
pain
he
suffered
made
him
moan
incessantly
and
piteously,
and
his
moaning
sounded
terrible
in
the
darkness
of
the
autumn
night.
He
had
spent
the
first
night
in
the
same
yard
as
the
Rostovs.
The
countess
said
she
had
been
unable
to
close
her
eyes
on
account
of
his
moaning,
and
at
Mytishchi
she
moved
into
a
worse
hut
simply
to
be
farther
away
from
the
wounded
man.
In
the
darkness
of
the
night
one
of
the
servants
noticed,
above
the
high
body
of
a
coach
standing
before
the
porch,
the
small
glow
of
another
fire.
One
glow
had
long
been
visible
and
everybody
knew
that
it
was
Little
Mytishchi
burning--set
on
fire
by
Mamonov's
Cossacks.
"But
look
here,
brothers,
there's
another
fire!"
remarked
an
orderly.
All
turned
their
attention
to
the
glow.
"But
they
told
us
Little
Mytishchi
had
been
set
on
fire
by
Mamonov's
Cossacks."
"But
that's
not
Mytishchi,
it's
farther
away."
"Look,
it
must
be
in
Moscow!"
Two
of
the
gazers
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
coach
and
sat
down
on
its
steps.
"It's
more
to
the
left,
why,
Little
Mytishchi
is
over
there,
and
this
is
right
on
the
other
side."
Several
men
joined
the
first
two.
"See
how
it's
flaring,"
said
one.
"That's
a
fire
in
Moscow:
either
in
the
Sushchevski
or
the
Rogozhski
quarter."
No
one
replied
to
this
remark
and
for
some
time
they
all
gazed
silently
at
the
spreading
flames
of
the
second
fire
in
the
distance.
Old
Daniel
Terentich,
the
count's
valet
(as
he
was
called),
came
up
to
the
group
and
shouted
at
Mishka.
"What
are
you
staring
at,
you
good-for-nothing?...
The
count
will
be
calling
and
there's
nobody
there;
go
and
gather
the
clothes
together."
"I
only
ran
out
to
get
some
water,"
said
Mishka.
"But
what
do
you
think,
Daniel
Terentich?
Doesn't
it
look
as
if
that
glow
were
in
Moscow?"
remarked
one
of
the
footmen.
Daniel
Terentich
made
no
reply,
and
again
for
a
long
time
they
were
all
silent.
The
glow
spread,
rising
and
falling,
farther
and
farther
still.
"God
have
mercy....
It's
windy
and
dry..."
said
another
voice.
"Just
look!
See
what
it's
doing
now.
O
Lord!
You
can
even
see
the
crows
flying.
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
sinners!"
"They'll
put
it
out,
no
fear!"
"Who's
to
put
it
out?"
Daniel
Terentich,
who
had
hitherto
been
silent,
was
heard
to
say.
His
voice
was
calm
and
deliberate.
"Moscow
it
is,
brothers,"
said
he.
"Mother
Moscow,
the
white..."
his
voice
faltered,
and
he
gave
way
to
an
old
man's
sob.
And
it
was
as
if
they
had
all
only
waited
for
this
to
realize
the
significance
for
them
of
the
glow
they
were
watching.
Sighs
were
heard,
words
of
prayer,
and
the
sobbing
of
the
count's
old
valet.
CHAPTER
XXXI
The
valet,
returning
to
the
cottage,
informed
the
count
that
Moscow
was
burning.
The
count
donned
his
dressing
gown
and
went
out
to
look.
Sonya
and
Madame
Schoss,
who
had
not
yet
undressed,
went
out
with
him.
Only
Natasha
and
the
countess
remained
in
the
room.
Petya
was
no
longer
with
the
family,
he
had
gone
on
with
his
regiment
which
was
making
for
Troitsa.
The
countess,
on
hearing
that
Moscow
was
on
fire,
began
to
cry.
Natasha,
pale,
with
a
fixed
look,
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
icons
just
where
she
had
sat
down
on
arriving
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
father's
words.
She
was
listening
to
the
ceaseless
moaning
of
the
adjutant,
three
houses
off.
"Oh,
how
terrible,"
said
Sonya
returning
from
the
yard
chilled
and
frightened.
"I
believe
the
whole
of
Moscow
will
burn,
there's
an
awful
glow!
Natasha,
do
look!
You
can
see
it
from
the
window,"
she
said
to
her
cousin,
evidently
wishing
to
distract
her
mind.
But
Natasha
looked
at
her
as
if
not
understanding
what
was
said
to
her
and
again
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
the
stove.
She
had
been
in
this
condition
of
stupor
since
the
morning,
when
Sonya,
to
the
surprise
and
annoyance
of
the
countess,
had
for
some
unaccountable
reason
found
it
necessary
to
tell
Natasha
of
Prince
Andrew's
wound
and
of
his
being
with
their
party.
The
countess
had
seldom
been
so
angry
with
anyone
as
she
was
with
Sonya.
Sonya
had
cried
and
begged
to
be
forgiven
and
now,
as
if
trying
to
atone
for
her
fault,
paid
unceasing
attention
to
her
cousin.
"Look,
Natasha,
how
dreadfully
it
is
burning!"
said
she.
"What's
burning?"
asked
Natasha.
"Oh,
yes,
Moscow."
And
as
if
in
order
not
to
offend
Sonya
and
to
get
rid
of
her,
she
turned
her
face
to
the
window,
looked
out
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
see
anything,
and
again
settled
down
in
her
former
attitude.
"But
you
didn't
see
it!"
"Yes,
really
I
did,"
Natasha
replied
in
a
voice
that
pleaded
to
be
left
in
peace.
Both
the
countess
and
Sonya
understood
that,
naturally,
neither
Moscow
nor
the
burning
of
Moscow
nor
anything
else
could
seem
of
importance
to
Natasha.
The
count
returned
and
lay
down
behind
the
partition.
The
countess
went
up
to
her
daughter
and
touched
her
head
with
the
back
of
her
hand
as
she
was
wont
to
do
when
Natasha
was
ill,
then
touched
her
forehead
with
her
lips
as
if
to
feel
whether
she
was
feverish,
and
finally
kissed
her.
"You
are
cold.
You
are
trembling
all
over.
You'd
better
lie
down,"
said
the
countess.
"Lie
down?
All
right,
I
will.
I'll
lie
down
at
once,"
said
Natasha.
When
Natasha
had
been
told
that
morning
that
Prince
Andrew
was
seriously
wounded
and
was
traveling
with
their
party,
she
had
at
first
asked
many
questions:
Where
was
he
going?
How
was
he
wounded?
Was
it
serious?
And
could
she
see
him?
But
after
she
had
been
told
that
she
could
not
see
him,
that
he
was
seriously
wounded
but
that
his
life
was
not
in
danger,
she
ceased
to
ask
questions
or
to
speak
at
all,
evidently
disbelieving
what
they
told
her,
and
convinced
that
say
what
she
might
she
would
still
be
told
the
same.
All
the
way
she
had
sat
motionless
in
a
corner
of
the
coach
with
wide
open
eyes,
and
the
expression
in
them
which
the
countess
knew
so
well
and
feared
so
much,
and
now
she
sat
in
the
same
way
on
the
bench
where
she
